	      - Not yet used for extensions.
	      - Better descriptions, download updates, ...

	Compiling problems?
	  - run cmake again to include the new *.h, *.cpp and *.ui files...
	  - if mainwindow.cpp can't find <avogadro/pluginmanager.h>, copy the
	    file to /usr/(local/)include/avogadro

	* libavogadro/src/boost.h: Add extract_swig_wrapped_ptr to convert
	SWIG object (from openbabel) to be converted to boost::python/C++
	objects. Still very limited, but you can now do:

	>>> atom.SetAtomicNum(6)
	>>> Avogadro.molecule.AddAtom(atom)

2008-06-13  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/CMakeLists.txt,
	libavogadro/src/extensions/gaussianextension.*,
	libavogadro/src/extensions/qcheminputdialog.*: Added a new QChem input
	deck generator. The input file generated is still not correct but
	VLANs and the fact that it compiles mean it is better to add it now.

2008-06-12  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* avogadro/src/mainwindow.cpp: When opening a 2D file, ask to do a
	quick conversion to 3D. (scale bonds, wedge -> Z+1, hash -> Z-1, 
	UFF 100 steps, should we add hydrogens?)

2008-06-11  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/aligntool.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/tools/clickmeasuretool.cpp: Fixed initialisation of

	form of the z-matrix as an option.

2008-06-08  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.*: Functions for named selections.

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/selectextension.*,
	libavogadro/src/extension/namedselectionmodel.*: Use them. At the
	moment the model is a simple list. I needed this functionality for
	specifying interaction groups in the force field setup dialog. This
	would be expanded in the future (tree view).

	* libavogadro/src/boost.h: adjust OBMol::AddHydrogens() for added pH
	paramter.

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.*: Add resized() signal.

	vertical size of the GAMESS dialog, fixes bug 1982113.

2008-06-04  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/surfaceengine.cpp: Scale numBoxes with
	quality.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/surfaceengine.cpp: Instead of iterating over
	all atoms for each grid point, iterate over all atoms once and only
	update grid points around the atom. This is 100-200x times faster...

2008-06-04  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp: Added more verbosity to the engine
	loading in order to help diagnose issues.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/sphereengine.*: Added a quick render
	function to fix rendering when quick draw is used.

	* avogadro/src/addenginedialog.cpp: Fixes bug 1984080 - the added
	engine was somewhat random before.

2008-06-03  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* i18n/*, scripts/extract-messages.sh: Added additional resources
	for .pot and .po file generation to integrate with
	Rosetta/Launchpad. Includes pt and es initial translations.

	* avogadro/src/CMakeLists.txt: Use a file glob for ts files to
	build into qm files.

2008-06-03  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/engine.h, libavogadro/src/extension.h,
	libavogadro/src/tool.h: Bumped our plugin version to 1.1 - should help
	with bugs 1973909 and 1982102 - warning a make clean is needed.

2008-06-02  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/dipoleengine.*: New dipole moment engine
	-- needs more work, but displays dipole moments from Gaussian,
	GAMESS and Q-Chem output  with recent OB-trunk.

2008-06-02  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/orbitalengine.cpp: Fixed bug 1968565 -
	orbitals are now cleared correctly along with everything else.

2008-05-30  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/gaussianinputdialog.*: Implemented
	showing and hiding of the preview text - defaults to shown.

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/CMakeLists.txt,
	libavogadro/src/extensions/templateextension.*: Fixed up the template
	extension so that it would actually compile, added an example minimal
	entry in the CMake file too (commented out).

2008-05-30  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* avogadro/src/mainwindow.cpp: emit enableEngineSettingsButton(false)
	when you delete an engine. Otherwise when you pressed "Settings...",
	it would segfault.

2008-05-30  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp, libavogadro/src/toolgroup.cpp,
	avogadro/src/mainwindow.cpp: In windows, use
	QCoreApplication::applicationDirPath() to find the plugins. 
	(fixes #1977338)

2008-05-30  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/constraintsdialog.ui: Disable unimplemented
	Save/Load buttons.

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/forcefieldextension.*: Only create new

	(views) and models when needed. Call QObject::deleteLater() on both
	the model and the view in PropertiesView::hideEvent().

	* libavogadro/src/tools/autoopttool.*: Exit, wait, and delete the
	thread in the destructor. Display the energy while running. Added
	conjugate gradients again.

2008-05-28  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/insertfragmentdialog.cpp: workaround for bug
	#1977172. Create a new OBConversion object each time you insert a
	fragment from the library.

2008-05-28  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/directorytreemodel.*: Invalidate persistent
	indexes. See this blogpost for details: last code block at the bottom
	http://der-dakon.net/blog/KDE/persistent-crash.html (This fixes the
	crashes I was having with the "Reset List" button.

2008-05-28  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.*: Add method to clear unit cell data.

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/unitcell*: Improved unit cell

2008-05-26  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* avogadro/src/mainwindow.cpp: Fixed PR 1973714 - removed the file
	ending from the file name passed to the save dialog. Also placed the
	macchempasteboard.h in a Mac ifdef to fix compilation on other OSes.

2008-05-27  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/drawtool.cpp: Do not try to change the bond
	order for X-H bonds when adjust hydrogens is on. Not sure if we should
	ever have double bonds to hydrogens...

	* avogadro/src/CMakeLists.txt,
	avogaro/src/mac/locversion.plist.in: Add additional Mac i18n

	* CMakeLists.txt: Bump our dependencies on CMake and Qt.

2008-05-22  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/insertfragmentdialog.cpp: Fix insert smiles.
	Also disable the driectoryTreeView and smilesLineEdit while in insert
	mode. This makes it impossible to change the smiles and forget to
	press Stop/Start.

2008-05-22  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/python/deleteAll.py: Fixed the
	deleteAll script for the new DeleteAtom function signature.

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/pythonextension.cpp: Search the system
	wide path for Python scripts too.

2008-05-20  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	Changes from the win32 build:

	* CMakeLists.txt: Change "C:\Program Files\avogadro" into  "C:\\Program
	Files\\avogadro".

	* avogadro/src/main.cpp: Windows build had problems with printVersion/
	printHelp. Quick fix with cout & #ifdef WIN32.

	* libavogadro/src/cylinder.cpp: Make sure M_PI isdefined.

	* libavogadro/src/elementtranslate.cpp: Global instance should be
	extern.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/iso.cpp: MSVC doesn't have
	__attribute__((aligned(16)). Quick fix with #ifdef WIN32 and without
	the data alignment.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/labelengine.cpp: Local instance should not
	be extern.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/polygonengine.cpp: Change static_cast<const
	Atom*> into static_cast<Atom*>.

	* libavogadro/src/periodictableview.cpp: Local instance should not be
	extern.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/aligntool.cpp: Change static_cast<const Atom*> 
	into static_cast<Atom*>.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/bondcentrictool.cpp: This file defined its own
	isnan() function which resulted in a conflict with OpenBabel::IsNan().
	Now uses OpenBabel::IsNan().

	* libavogadro/src/tools/drawtool.cpp:  Local instance should not be
	extern.

	* scripts/avogadro.nsi: update installer generating script.

2008-05-19  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/drawtool.cpp: Fixed the same bug that was
	fixed in navigate tool where no atoms were in the molecule.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/navigatetool.cpp: Made the valid molecule
	check safer.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/manipulatetool.*: Made the manipulate tool a
	lot faster by only saving undo points on mouse up and mouse down.

	* CMakeLists.txt, avogadro/src/CMakeLists.txt: Added -DQT_NO_DEBUG to
	release mode and removed a -DQT_DEBUG in the Avogadro app build file.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/CMakeLists.txt,
	libavogadro/src/extensions/CMakeLists.txt,
	libavogadro/src/tools/CMakeLists.txt: Changed build scripts to build
	all plugins as modules, this seems more appropriate after reading the
	CMake man page and should decrease build times due to less linkage.

2008-05-17  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* avogadro/src/CMakeLists.txt, libavogadro/src/CMakeLists.txt: Add the
	OpenBabel library directory to the linker path.

	* CMakeLists.txt: Respect the users CXXFLAGS.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/clickmeasuretool.*: Add some caching in the
	tool so measurements are only echoed once.

	* avogadro/src/mainwindow.ui: Tweaks to the UI.

2008-05-16  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/orbitalengine.*,
	libavogadro/src/engines/orbitalsettingswidget.ui: Propagate new grids
	through to the combo and some UI cleanup.

2008-05-16  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/iso.cpp: Surfaces are now centered around atom
	again. The - 0.5 * m_stepSize correction is only needed for 
	vMarchCube1(float,float,float). This is a bug in OBFloatGrid? 

2008-05-16  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/drawtool.*: Use new
	OBForceField::SetIgnoreAtom() to make sure the new atom doesn't push
	away other fragment you want to connect with. Also fix the atom when
	you hit an atom that already exists. This makes drawing rings with
	AutoOpt enabled really easy.

	* libavogadro/src/autoopttool.*: Use new OBForceField::SetFixAtom()

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/animationdialog.ui: Make the dialog
	more compact. Removed the group boxes.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/autorotatetool.cpp, 
	libavogadro/src/extensions/animationextension.cpp, 
	libavogadro/src/extensions/orbitalextension.cpp, 
	libavogadro/src/extensions/gaussianextension.cpp, 
	libavogadro/src/extensions/propextension.cpp, 
	avogadro/src/mainwindow.ui, avogadro/src/mainwindow.cpp:
	More interface cleanup -- any menu item or button which brings up
	a dialog should have "..." at the end. (KDE, Windows, and Mac UI guidelines.)
	
2008-05-16  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/orbitaldialog.*: Hide more advanced
	options for now, minor cleanup.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/aligntool.*: Added options to align everything
	or just the current molecule.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/aligntool.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/tools/autorotatetool.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/tools/bondcentrictool.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/tools/selectrotatetool.cpp: More layout improvements.

	to edit the input deck, revert etc.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/drawtool.cpp: Added some extra signals on
	mouse release to ensure molecule is updated.

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/gaussianinputdialog.ui: Fixed the tab
	ordering of the dialog.

	* libavogadro/src/periodictableview.cpp: Some changes to improve
	layout in Linux and hopefully Windows.

	* cmake/modules/FindOpenBabel2.cmake: Hopefully a new and improved
	FindOpenBabel2 using the new PkgConfig functions.

	* CMakeLists.txt: Set the CMake policy for CMake 2.6.

2008-05-15  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* avogadro/mainwindow.h, avogadro/mainwindow.cpp: Changed engine
	configuration to a new button which brings up an extra "settings"
	window with tabs. Add signal/slot for enabling the Engine Settings
	window -- only enables button for engines with settings.

	* src/enginelistview.cpp, primitivetreeview.cpp: 
	Add setUniformItemSizes(true) -- supposedly improves performance.

2008-05-15  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/primitive.cpp, libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/engines/surfaceengine.cpp: Made some changes to the
	surface engine and the GLWidget to improve locking. Seems to have
	prevented crashes in the surface engine here. More locking is needed.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/selectrotatetool.cpp: Added Control modifier
	to the tool to fix PR 1962903 - toggle selected primitives.

	* libavogadro/src/color.h: Cast GLFloats to ints to suppress warning.

	* libavogadro/src/CMakeLists.txt: Only add the Boost_INCLUDE_DIR if
	boost is found - fixes a CMake error with CMake 2.6.

2008-05-14  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/pythonextension.cpp: Fixed typo.

2008-05-14  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

2008-05-12  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* avogadro/src/mainwindow.cpp: Fixed the code to fail properly when
	the file to be opened does not exist.

2008-05-12  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/propmodel.cpp
	libavogadro/src/extensions/propextension.h
	libavogadro/src/extensions/propextension.cpp:
	Updates to fix some translations and to allow resizing the window
	without showing large amounts of empty space.

	* Many files: Fix a pile of Krazy warnings.

	* avogadro/src/mainwindow.cpp: Implement save to a new file, then
	a rename. (If others have ways to improve this, please let me know.)

2008-05-11  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp: Fix uninitialised undoStack pointer.

2008-05-10  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	molecule was already aligned to the chosen axis.

2008-05-09  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* CMakeLists.txt: Install our fragments. Destination may need
	tuning on Linux and Windows.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/insertfragmentdialog.cpp: Update to
	include default fragment paths as much as possible. This will need
	tuning on Linux and Windows. Does Cmake set a -D define for an
	installation path, e.g. /usr vs /usr/local?

	* libavogadro/src/tools/directorytreemodel.cpp: Ignore hidden files.

2008-05-08  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/forcefieldextension.cpp: Added a
	QMessageBox::information() box to display the energy when the user
	clicks "Calculate Energy". (#1947745)

2008-05-08  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/forcefieldextension.cpp: Move call to
	SetLogFile (fixes #1960307)

2008-05-07  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* * CMakeLists.txt, libavogadro/src/CMakeLists.txt,
	libavogadro/src/extensions/CMakeLists.txt: Optionally use CMake 2.6
	and the much improved FindBoost to check for and use Boost Python on
	more than just Linux - works great on the Mac.

2008-05-07  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/forcefielddialog.*: Removed gradients
	option. Now handled OBForceField::HasAnalyticalGradients()

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/conformersearchdialog.*: Same.

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/forcefieldextension.*: Same.

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/constraintsdialog.*: Update for static
	constraints. We now only need to set it once.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/autoopttool.*: Replaced convergence spin box
	by steps per update spin box.

2008-05-05  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/orbitalextension.*: Set the navigate tool
	as the active tool after loading a file.

2008-05-04  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/drawtool.cpp: Added saving of the current
	element to the draw tool.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/autoopttool.cpp: Add checks in for whether the
	force field was initialised correctly.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/orbitalengine.*: More updates to the orbital
	engine to improve rendering consistency.

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/orbitalextension.cpp: Fixed another
	crasher - when no basis set has been loaded.

2008-05-03  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/orbitalextension.cpp: Corrected the MO
	numbering in the cube titles.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/orbitalengine.*: Added some settings
	persistence, improved the quickRender a little too.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/clickmeasuretool.*: More guarded pointers to
	prevent crashing caused by dangling pointers.

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp: Only switch to quickRender on mouse
	move, not press.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/aligntool.*: Used guarded pointers (QPointer)
	to make the align tool much harder to crash.

2008-05-02  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/orbitaldialog.*,
	libavogadro/src/extensions/orbitalextension.*: Adding some extra
	detail on the cube parameters along with the ability to modify this.
	Also added a little extra debug output while support if improved.

2008-04-30  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/gaussianinputdialog.*: Added several new
	options and modifications based upon discussion in bug 1954113.
	Editing of the text edit box still needs to be added.

	* avogadro/src/mainwindow.cpp, avogadro/src/mainwindow.ui: Updated
	with new view menu actions for axes and debug information.

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp: Update the display after axes or debug
	rendering is turned on or off.

2008-04-29  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	*  libavogadro/src/tools/align.png,
	libavogadro/src/tools/aligntool.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/tools/aligntool.qrc: New icon for align tool.

	* avogadro/src/mainwindow.cpp: Fix up Mac/Windows save dialogs.
	Also disable save/revert menu actions until the document is modified.

	* avogadro/src/savedialog.cpp: Remove incorrect #ifdef for setting
	filters on Mac. Now done in mainwindow.cpp. Use static QFileDialog
	on Windows (and Mac).

2008-04-29  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/gaussianinputdialog.cpp: Several fixes
	suggested by Michael Banck in bugs 1954108, 1954101 and 1954099.

2008-04-28  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/orbitalengine.*,
	libavogadro/src/engines/orbitalsettingswidget.ui: Only recalculate the
	isosurface when editing is finished, minimum spinner value of zero.

	* avogadro/src/mainwindow.cpp: Tracked the bug of the disappearing
	molecule - it was never set for extensions after the first window.

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/orbitalextension.cpp: Return if the file
	name is empty.

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/gaussianinputdialog.cpp: Made the reset
	button work. Also connect molecule signals to the dialog.

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/gaussianinputdialog.cpp: Update the
	preview when setMolecule is called. Also added some logic to disable
	basis sets with certain theories.

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/basisset.cpp: Actually call the doD and
	doD5 functions - this really helps when trying to use d-type
	orbitals to generate cubes...

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/CMakeLists.txt,
	libavogadro/src/extensions/gaussianextension.*,
	libavogadro/src/extensions/gaussianinputdialog.*: Added a new Gaussian
	input deck generator. Still quite basic with a few bugs but is already
	generating valid input decks.

2008-04-27  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* avogadro/src/mainwindow.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/extensions/pythonextension.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/tools/directorytreemodel.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/tools/selectrotatetool.cpp: Found a few more cases
	where foreach loops needed fixing.

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp, libavogadro/src/toolgroup.cpp: Made
	changes to foreach loops as suggested by Albert Astals Cid, prevent
	unnecessary creation of temporary objects.

2008-04-25  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* libavogadro/src/primitiveitemmodel.cpp: Added in layout change
	signals. Will hopefully prevent crashing.

	* avogadro/src/mainwindow.ui: Move export to a new submenu of
	File.

	* avogadro/src/mainwindow.*: Add drag-and-drop support. Files
	dragged onto a window will be loaded.

2008-04-25  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/basisset.*,
	libavogadro/src/extensions/gaussianfchk.*,
	libavogadro/src/extensions/orbitalextension.cpp: Port to use
	std::vector to store everything. Changed the way normalisation is
	handled. Added d-type orbitals - this has not been verified yet.

2008-04-24  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/basisset.cpp: Added destructor bits.

2008-04-23  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/orbitalextension.cpp: Sorted out the units
	in the cube calculation initialisation...

2008-04-22  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/orbitalextension.cpp: Work out the
	dimensions of the cube from the molecule, also clear the molecule.
	Also added a call to processEvents() to maintain interactivity.

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/basisset.*,
	libavogadro/src/extensions/gaussianfchk.*,
	libavogadro/src/extensions/orbitaldialog.*,
	libavogadro/src/extensions/orbitalextension.*,
	libavogadro/src/extensions/CMakeLists.txt: Added a new orbital
	extension. This extension uses the new BasisSet class along with
	GaussianFchk to load a formatted Gaussian checkpoint file and
	calculate MOs. Support for more programs and more features soon.

2008-04-17  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* libavogadro/src/treeitem.*: New class for handling filenames in
	model/view context, particularly a tree browser.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/directorytreemodel.*: New class for
	handling directory trees with multiple paths. (Basic Qt class
	QDirModel gives too much file info and doesn't handle multiple
	top-level directories.)

	* libavogadro/src/tools/insertfragmentdialog.*: New class to
	combine the SMILES generation and reading in fragment files. Still
	needs a bit of polish.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/drawtool.*: Use above.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/drawcommand.*: Change InsertSMILES class
	to InsertFragment (now that we have a general fragment browser).

2008-04-16  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* libavogadro/src/navigate.*: Add general rotate(x, y, z) method
	(for scripting).

2008-04-15  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/autoopttool.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/tools/bondcentrictool.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/tools/manipulatetool.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/tools/navigatetool.cpp: Use the shift key rather than
	alt key as the second modifier.

	* avogadro/src/config.h.in, libavogadro/src/config.h.in: Added
	INSTALL_LIBDIR define in order to more reliably load plugins.

	* avogadro/src/mainwindow.cpp, libavogadro/src/glwidget.*,
	libavogadro/src/toolgroup.cpp: Adapted the loading scheme to use
	INSTALL_LIBDIR - far more reliable.

2008-04-13  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* avogadro/src/settingsdialog.*: Removed the axes and debug display
	options from the global config - to be relocated to the view menu.
	Also (hopefully) improved the display quality feedback.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/navigate.* -> libavogadro/src/navigate.*,
	libavogadro/include/avogadro/navigate.h,
	libavogadro/src/tools/CMakeLists.txt,
	libavogadro/src/tools/aligntool.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/tools/autoopttool.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/tools/bondcentrictool.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/tools/clickmeasuretool.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/tools/drawtool.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/tools/manipulatetool.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/tools/navigatetool.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/tools/selectrotatetool.cpp: Moved the navigate
	functions from the tools directory into the library. They should be
	exposed as part of our API and would be useful in scripting.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/CMakeLists.txt: Removed duplicate definition
	of bondcentrictool.

2008-04-13  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/surfaceengine.*,
	libavogadro/src/engines/surfacesettingswidget.ui: Clipping now works
	for any specified plane.

2008-04-12  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/surfaceengine.*,
	libavogadro/src/engines/surfacesettingswidget.ui: Added clipping
	plane. This feature could later be moved to glwidget to clip any
	engine... This would probably require engines to have a clipped and
	solid property (like they currently have radius)

2008-04-09  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/glpainter.cpp, libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp: Parts
	of the patch from Benoit Jacob - fix handling of quality change.

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp: Fixed bug where display lists were
	not being invalidated when the display quality was adjusted.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/forceengine.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/engines/orbitalengine.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/engines/surfaceengine.cpp: Fixed some compiler
	warnings.

2008-04-09  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/camera.h, libavogadro/src/textrenderer.h,
	libavogadro/src/tools/drawtool.cpp: Fixed a few compiler warnings.

2008-04-08  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/CMakeLists.txt: Remove duplicate call to automoc.

2008-04-07  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* CMakeLists.txt: Only set the linker flags on Linux systems.

	* libavogadro/src/CMakeLists.txt: Disabled the visibility flags for
	now as they seem to break forcefield support.

	* avogadro/src/mainwindow.cpp: Added a warning dialog when no engines
	and/or tools were loaded.

	* libavogadro/src/CMakeLists.txt,
	libavogadro/src/engines/CMakeLists.txt, libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp:
	Statically linked the ball and stick engine to libavogadro. This
	guarantees the minimal ability to display a molecule.

2008-04-06  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* CMakeLists.txt: Added the pedantic compiler flag to spot many issues
	with C++ code such as those picked up by KDE developers. Also
	introduce symbol hiding if a recent GCC is installed. We now need to
	explicitly export all symbols on Linux/Apple systems.

	* cmake/modules/FindBoostPython.cmake,
	cmake/modules/MacroEnsureVersion.cmake: Extra cmake modules from KDE
	4.1 (trunk) to improve Boost Python detection and check versions.

	* libavogadro/src/CMakeLists.txt,
	libavogadro/src/extensions/CMakeLists.txt: Improve the Boost Python
	detection and link to the dynamic Python library.

	* avogadro/src/application.h, avogadro/src/enginelistview.h,
	avogadro/src/engineprimitiveswidget.h,
	avogadro/src/enginesetupwidget.h, avogadro/src/mainwindow.h,
	libavogadro/src/engines/orbitalengine.h,
	libavogadro/src/engines/surfaceengine.h, libavogadro/src/extension.h,
	libavogadro/src/extensions/forcefieldextension.h,
	libavogadro/src/extensions/gamessefpmatchdialog.h,
	libavogadro/src/extensions/gamessextension.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/extensions/gamessextension.h,
	libavogadro/src/extensions/gamessinputdata.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/extensions/gamessinputdata.h,
	libavogadro/src/extensions/h2methylextension.h,
	libavogadro/src/extensions/hydrogensextension.h,
	libavogadro/src/extensions/propextension.h,
	libavogadro/src/extensions/pythonextension.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/extensions/pythonextension.h,
	libavogadro/src/extensions/selectextension.h,
	libavogadro/src/extensions/unitcellextension.h,
	libavogadro/src/tools/autoopttool.h: Fixed errors pointed out by the
	pedantic compiler flag - mainly extra ;s and ,s.

	* libavogadro/src/pythoninterpreter.h: Ensure the Python interpreter
	exports its symbols.

	* libavogadro/src/glpainter.cpp: Patch from Thiago Macieira in KDE
	commit 794048. You're not allowed to use C99 variable-length in C++.

	* libavogadro/src/periodictableview.h: Only export the
	PeriodicTableView class.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/navigatetool.cpp: Remember to account for the
	situation where no molecule is loaded.

	* libavogadro/src/global.h: Added visibility attributes to the
	A_EXPORT definitions so that our symbols are correctly exported when
	the default visibility is changed to hidden (as in KDE 4.1 trunk).

2008-04-04  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/aligntool.h,
	libavogadro/src/tools/aligntool.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/tools/aligntool.qrc,
	libavogadro/src/tools/CMakeLists.txt: Added new align tool. Currently
	it just aligns the selected atom to the origin, if there are two
	selected atoms they will be aligned along the chosen axis.

2008-04-03  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/axesengine.*,
	libavogadro/src/engines/CMakeLists.txt: Added new axes engine to
	display the x, y, z axes in the scene. More options soon.

2008-04-01  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/gamessinputdialog.cpp: Correct bug where
	nd was also being used to set np in the basic tab.

2008-03-23  Donald E. Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* avogadro/src/mainwindow.cpp: when extensions reqest a new menu item they
	are put in before the settings menu.

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/pythonextension.*: the python extension now
	searches $prefix/share/libavogadro-VERSION/scripts and
	$HOME/.avogadro/scripts for python scripts to load.  There are some
	examples in the libavogadro/src/extensions/python/ directory.

	* libavogadro/src/pythoninterpreter.*: made some fixes and updates to the
	python interpreter to allow evaluation and execution easier with custom
	local namespaces.

2008-03-22  Donald E. Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* avogadro/src/mainwindow.cpp: fixed bug with dock window loading being
	in the wrong loop.

	* libavogadro/src/tool.h: make setMolecule a slot

	* libavogadro/src/extension.[cpp|h]: make Extension a QObject and
	get ready for the library.  added setMolecule function.

	+ libavogadro/src/extensions: move extenstions to the library

	* libavogadro/src/extensions/*: modify extensions to use a signal to emit
	messages and utilize the setMolecule function.

2008-03-21  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* testfiles/ch3cl.cube.gz: Deleted incorrect test file.

	* testfiles/multicube.cubes.gz: Added new multi-cube test file
	supplied by Louis Ricard.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/selectrotatetool.cpp: Modified the selection
	behaviour to more closely match other applications. Clicking on atoms
	and drawing boxes now selects just the primitives in that area,
	holding down shift adds the new primitives to the selection.

2008-03-12  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* avogadro/src/extensions/wiitrackextension.*: Wiimote head tracking
	extension.

	* avogadro/src/extensions/CMakeLists.txt: Do not compile Wiimote
	head tracking extension as default

2008-03-11  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/colorbutton.h: Added A_EXPORT.

	* libavogadro/src/periodictableview.h: Added A_EXPORT.

2008-03-10  Jordan Mantha  <jordan.mantha@gmail.com>

	* doc/CMakeLists.txt: fix docbook2{pdf,html} detection. Also added some
	install rules but left it commented out for now as it's still buggy.

2008-03-10  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/povpainter.cpp: Add } to camera {. Fixes #1911507

2008-03-09  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/iso.cpp: Corrected a bug where the surface
	generation could step off the end of the cube by one unit in x, y and
	z. Also removed some of the debug output.

2008-03-09  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/orbital*.*: Add support for multiple
	orbitals/cubes.

	* testfiles/ch3cl.cube.gz: Example file for multiple cubes.

2008-03-08  Jordan Mantha  <jordan.mantha@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/ribbonengine.*: Added support for
	including nitrogens in the protein backbone chain. Also add
	support for engine configuration persistence (read/writeSettings)
	* libavogadro/src/engines/ribbonsettingswidget.ui: add checkbox
	for above.

2008-03-08  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/glpainter.cpp: Patch from Jordan Mantha
	<jordan.mantha@gmail.com> fixes ribbon rendering - go right to the end
	of the protein backbone. Thanks for the patch Jordan.

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp: Added some read and write locks at
	appropriate looking places in the GLWidget. Should help but it may
	need to be finer grained in places. Reverted - locks up a lot...

	* avogadro/src/main.cpp: Looks like some drivers have broken
	XInitThreads() functions. Only enable in threaded GL builds.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/surfaceengine.*: Just return from the render
	function if the VdW thread is running - should fix crashes.

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp: Removed the doneCurrent() calls in the
	non-threaded GL code paths. These calls were breaking hits calls  etc.

2008-03-07  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* avogadro/src/main.cpp: Add extra GL initialisation debug output.

2008-03-06  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* avogadro/src/mainwindow.cpp: Check that a window isn't moved
	off-screen on Mac or Windows (since we remember window positions
	on those platforms). PR#1903437.
	(saveFile) Add .cml extension to a filename if none is provided. PR#1817621.

2008-03-06  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/eyecandy.cpp: Make the eye candy solid, this
	gets rid of potentially expensive blending operations in what should
	be our quick display pipeline. Visually still looks great IMHO.

	* libavogadro/src/engine.cpp: Emit changed when the engine's status is
	changed, i.e. enabled->disabled or vice versa.

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.*: Added a new invalidateDLs slot that
	should be called whenever the display lists need invalidating. Updated
	our display list invalidation to hopefully be more efficient.

2008-03-06  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/forceengine.*: Render forces on atoms. Uses
	OBConformerData, needs latest OB SVN to work.

2008-03-05  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp: Stop invalidating the cache on mouse
	release - I think we have all the events covered that should
	invalidate the cache now without this catch all.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/orbitalengine.cpp: Just draw GL_LINES.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/selectrotatetool.cpp: Change cursor types
	depending upon the action being performed - better visual cues.

2008-03-04  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp: Added a second light source to our
	scene - position and brightness may need tweaking. Surface rendering
	was improved by this.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/bsdyengine.cpp: Draw multiple bonds in quick
	draw. Switching between multiple and single bonds can be distracting.
	Should possibly switch to single bonds only with large molecules.

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp: Add back in some makeCurrent calls
	that really were necessary outside of the threaded GL #ifdefs. This
	fixes PR#1906403.

2008-03-01  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/bsdyengine.*: Add a renderQuick function to
	this engine. Selected atoms/bonds rendered as opaque objects using the
	selection colour. Multiple bonds are not displayed. No transparency.

2008-02-29  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/engine.h: API cleanup - remove the second unused
	argument from the quickRender function.

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/engines/labelengine.*,
	libavogadro/src/engines/orbitalengine.*,
	libavogadro/src/engines/ribbonengine.*: Ported to use the new
	quickRender function.

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp: Correct a bug in the setSelected
	function which was causing it to toggle the selection rather than set
	it as the calling functions were expecting.

	* avogadro/src/mainwindow.cpp: Revert the earlier fix as setSelected
	now works as expected.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/selectrotatetool.cpp: Select atom should now
	also select bonds as well as atoms correctly.

	* avogadro/src/extensions/forcefieldextension.cpp: Disable the
	constraints menu item for now.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/orbitalengine.*,
	libavogadro/src/engines/orbitalsettingswidget.ui: Defaulted to not use
	interpolation, added a check box that will force interpolation.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/iso.h: Fixed the integer index based eval
	function to actually use the m_iso value set.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/iso.*: Added a new marching cubes function
	that does not use interpolation. This should significantly reduce the
	resources needed to calculated many surfaces.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/surfaceengine.cpp: Ported to use the new
	IsoGen class without interpolation - we calculate the VdW surface and
	so should never need to interpolate values.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/orbitalengine.cpp: Ported to continue
	interpolating for now. This engine should have optional interpolation
	but I need to hunt down a bug in the code first.

2008-02-28  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/surfaceengine.cpp: Update the surface engine
	to use the new features of the GridData class - requires fresh OB SVN.

2008-02-21  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp: Fixed up some of the makeCurrent and
	doneCurrent calls - should hopefully increase stability although I
	think threaded GL still needs some love (as well as my ATI driver!)

	* libavogadro/src/tools/manipulatetool.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/tools/navigatetool.cpp: Provide more visual cues by
	changing the mouse cursor.

2008-02-21  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/orbitalsettingswidget.ui,
	libavogadro/src/engines/orbitalengine.*,
	libavogadro/src/engines/surfaceengine.*,
	libavogadro/src/engines/surfacesettingswidget.ui: Removed the paddings
	and set step size spinners. Also removed the corresponding functions
	that set these properties.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/orbitalengine.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/engines/surfaceengine.cpp: Fixed the opacity slider
	to actually change the surface opacity. Ported to the new init
	function in IsoGen

	* libavogadro/src/engines/iso.*: Modified the IsoGen init function to
	take a PainterDevice and set the step size based up on the quality.

	* libavogadro/src/painter.h, libavogadro/src/glpainter.h,
	libavogadro/src/povpainter.h: Added quality as a new virtual function.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/iso.h,
	libavogadro/src/engines/orbitalengine.*,
	libavogadro/src/engines/surfaceengine.*,
	libavogadro/src/painterdevice.h: Tweaked include files a little so
	that IsoGen doesn't include the whole of GLWidget. Fixed others.

2008-02-19  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/*, libavogadro/src/tools/*: Added

2008-02-19  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/draw*.*: several bugfixes for drawing while
	adjust hydrogens is on. Drawing X-C possible again. Move
	ChangeElementDrawCommand to MouseRelease (from MousePress)

	* libavogadro/src/tools/autoopttool.*: While running, display text on
	the GLWidget, if setup fails, this will also be displayed.

2008-02-18  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/draw*.*: Insert Smiles is now undo-able.

2008-02-18  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/orbitalengine.*: Added renderTransparent and
	renderQuick functions and cleaned up the code where possible.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/surfaceengine.cpp: Modified to use the new
	IsoGen class, still needs more work to use renderTransparent etc.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/orbitalengine.*,
	libavogadro/src/engines/orbitalsettingswidget.ui: Used Geoff's new
	colour widget in the configuration dialog. Added support for drawing
	both the positive and negative iso surfaces as well as ensuring the
	surfaces are only recalculated if the molecule was modified.

2008-02-17  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* avogadro/src/addenginedialog.*: Set the default "name" when
	adding an engine to the engine type. (This saves some typing.)

	* libavogadro/src/tools/drawtool.*, libavogadro/src/tools/drawcommand.*:
	Indentation and comment cleanup in draw tool. Added initial
	support for adjusting hydrogens while drawing.

2008-02-17  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/drawtools.*, libavogadro/tools/drawcommand.*:
	Added small feature: when you left click a bond, the bond order is
	changed from 1->2, 2->3 and 3->1.
	This is can be undone, also made change element undo-able.

2008-02-15  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/iso.*: Moved VDWSurface to IsoGen. This
	makes the surface engine much more interactive. Also added a type
	parameter to the init function to set the surface type:
	VDWsurfaceType, OrbitalType, ...
	Small changes to VDWSurface to ensure only the primitives set for the
	engine are included in the surface.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/surfaceengine.*: Same as above + fix to set
	the opacity of RGB colored surfaces.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/orbitalengine.*: Comment out init() to make
	sure it still compiles.

2008-02-13  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/skeletontree.cpp: Fix bug with
	bond-centric manipulate tool. Translations and rotations were not
	telling atoms that they were updated. Fixes PR#1854343.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/autorotatetool.cpp: Quick fix for
	PR#1891101. Will not do rotations if no molecule is loaded.

	* libavogadro/src/colorbutton.*: New widget to show the current
	color and bring up a color picker when clicked.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/surfacesettingswidget.ui: Use it.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/surfaceengine.*: Ditto.

2008-02-09  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/surfaceengine2.*: Removed old files. Added
	Marcus and me to the copyright header.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/surfaceengine.*: Added settings widget.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/CMakeList.txt: Added settings widget.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/surfacesettingswidget.ui: Settings widget.

2008-02-04  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/clickmeasuretool.*: Added support for
	measuring the dihedral angle. Also made the tool update dynamically as
	the molecule is changed, optimised the label placement and ported it
	to use the OpenBabel functions to find the angles concerned.

2008-02-03  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/clickmeasuretool.cpp: Fix a bug where the
	angle was not calculated correctly. Thanks to Albert DeFusco for
	reporting the bug and providing a test case.

2008-01-09  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* avogadro/src/extensions/conformersearchdialog.cpp: Make use of new
	OpenBabel::OBRotorKeys class to determine the number of conformers
	generated with the Systematic rotor search.

	* avogadro/src/extensions/constraints*: Renamed BondConstraint to
	DistanceConstraint (latest OpenBabel needed, sorry for the
	inconvenience)

2007-12-19  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/autoopt.[h,cpp]: Use new
	HasAnalyticalGradients() method from Open Babel SVN trunk.

2007-12-19  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp: Fix the race condition in the render
	quick code.

	* libavogadro/src/camera.*: Added a copy constructor.

2007-12-18  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/autoopttool.[h,cpp]: Add support for molecular
	dynamics. This should probably move to it's own tool, where you can
	record and play trajectories.

2007-12-17  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* libavogadro/src/color.[h, cpp]: New method setToSelectionColor
	to allow overloading and customization of the selection color in
	render engines.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/*.cpp: Use it.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/*.cpp: Add Navigate::zoom() to wheel
	operations for all tools.

2007-12-15  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/ringengine.*: Added support for colouring
	the rings based upon the number of ring members.

2007-12-15  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/autoopttool.[h,cpp]: Add support for
	OBPluginList to dynamically get list of force field types.

	* avogadro/src/extensions/forcefieldextension*: As above.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/hbondengine.cpp: Add support for
	stippled lines.

2007-12-15  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/hbondengine.[h,cpp],
	libavogadro/src/engines/hbondsettingswidget.ui: Added hydrogen bond
	engine. I was planning on drawing stippled lines, but it seems that
	this isn't implemented yet.

2007-12-13  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/autoopttool.[h,cpp]: Added Numerical or
	Analytical gradients option. (was this left out for a reason? feel
	free to remove if this is the case)

	* avogadro/src/extensions/prop*.[h,cpp]: Added angles and torsions.

2007-12-13  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp: Invalidate the cache after mouse up.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/labelengine.*: Don't draw labels when using
	the renderQuick() method.

2007-12-13  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp (renderCrystal): Clean up main
	render() function with additional function to handle translations
	of crystal cells via display lists. Much cleaner code and should
	be faster on larger crystals.

2007-12-12  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp: Add in display lists for
	renderQuick. Wraps all engines into one list for maximum speed.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/wireengine.[h,cpp]: Skip display lists,
	as glWidget now handles this for us.

	* libavogadro/src/elementtranslate.cpp: Fix US spelling of
	aluminum. Marcus can adjust accordingly in GB translation.

2007-12-12  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp: Don't use dynamic scaling to render
	the axes - cylinders were reduced to lines before.

	* libavogadro/src/engine.h: Added a renderQuick() function that
	focuses on rendering the molecule quickly for interactivity.

	* libavogadro/src/glpainter.cpp: Use a reduced quality when dynamic
	scaling is not used - 1/3rd of max for that quality right now.

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp: Adding new logic for dealing with
	display list caches, calling renderQuick correctly etc.

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.*, avogadro/src/settingsdialog.ui,
	avogadro/src/settingsdialog.cpp, avogadro/src/mainwindow.*: Moved the
	debug information overlay to the GLWidget from the Engine.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/CMakeLists.txt,
	-libavogadro/src/engines/debugengine.*: Removed the debug engine.

2007-12-11  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/glpainter.*: Added a dynamic scaling variable to the
	class and a setter. This turns dynamic scaling on (default) and off.

	* avogadro/src/CMakeLists.txt, libavogadro/src/CMakeLists.txt,
	+i18n/avogadro_en_GB.ts: Added a British English translation.

2007-12-11  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* libavogadro/src/primitive.h: New primitive types defined for
	"future expansion."

	* avogadro/src/extensions/gamessinputdialog.ui: Fix typos
	mentioned by Benoit.

	* avogadro/src/extensions/propmodel.cpp,
	avogadro/src/extensions/propextension.cpp: Minor fixes to get
	compilation working again.

2007-12-11  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/autoopttool.[h,cpp]: Added "Ignored atoms are
	movable" and "Fixed atoms are movable". Small changes to ::redo() and
	::undo(), undo still seems to work. I had to change it to makje sure
	the passed molecule pointer would not point to a molecule that would
	be deleted. This caused the constraints in the model to be lossed.
	(note: OB does not support angle and torsion constraints yet, ignoring
	atoms only works for MMFF94 at the moment.)

	* avogadro/src/extentions/constraintsmodel.[h,cpp]: now connects to
	primitiveRemoved signal from a Molecule to delete invalid constraints
	as you remove atoms.

	* avogadro/src/extentions/constraintsdialog.[h,cpp]: You can now only
	add valid constraints.

	* avogadro/src/extentions/forcefieldextension.cpp: Added "Ignore
	selected atoms" and "Fix selected atoms" + changes to make sure
	constraints are consistent for both the forcefield extension and the
	AutoOpt tool. Undo doesn't work for conformersearch yet, I'll probably
	fix this by moving the ConformerSearchDialog to the ForceFieldCommand
	itself.

	* avogadro/src/extentions/liganddialog.[ui,h,cpp]: Dialog to create a
	ligand. (dockingextension)

	* avogadro/src/extentions/pocketdialog.[ui,h,cpp]: Dialog to create a
	pocket. (dockingextension)

	* avogadro/src/extentions/dockingextension.[h,cpp]: Avogadro class to
	handle docking.

	* avogadro/src/extensions/propmodel.cpp: Small  change to the way rows
	are added and deleted.

2007-12-10  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/painter.*, libavogadro/src/povpainter.h,
	libavogadro/src/glpainter.*: Added a drawCone function to draw 3D
	cones that can be used for arrows etc.

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.*: Ported the renderAxesOverlay function
	to use the new renderCone function.

2007-12-09  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* +libavogadro/src/periodictableview.*,
	+libavogadro/include/avogadro/periodictableview.h,
	-libavogadro/src/tools/periodictablegv.*,
	libavogadro/src/tools/CMakeLists.txt,
	libavogadro/src/tools/drawtool.*: Moved the PeriodicTableGV class into
	the libavogadro directory, changed its name to PeriodicTableView and
	added a global header so that it can be used more widely.

2007-12-09  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* avogadro/src/extensions/*: Added "Select by Element", reusing cryos'
	periodic table, "Select by Residue" and "Select Solvent". Select
	solvent needs expanding...

2007-12-08  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* avogadro/src/extensions/*: Added conformer search dialog.

2007-12-07  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* libavogadro/src/elementtranslate.[h,cpp]: New class to handle
	translation/i18n of element names.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/drawtool.cpp: Use the new translation
	feature. Also add in custom elements (from Periodic Table widget)
	into an ordered list.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/periodictablegv.cpp: Use the new
	translation feature.

2007-12-07  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* avogadro/src/extensions/: Improvements to the properties model, and
	table: This is now one class: PropertiesModel and PropertiesView. They
	both use a enum {} to set the type. There are currently 4 types:
	AtomType, BondType, ConformerType and CartesianType.

2007-12-06  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/drawtool.cpp: Enhanced custom element
	support. Picking elements from the table will add a new entry and
	select it. Picking elements form the table *already* in the list
	will simply select that element again.

	* scripts/distclean.sh: An enhanced "distclean" script for
	preparing source releases.

	* avogadro/CMakeLists.txt, libavogadro/CMakeLists.txt: Bumped
	version number to 0.3.0b2.

2007-12-06  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* avogadro/src/extensions/: You can now fix an atom, the rest will
	follow soon...

	* avogadro/src/extensions/: Added atom and bond properties and a
	cartesian coordinate editor.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/: same for AutoOpt

2007-12-05  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* +libavogadro/src/tools/periodictablegv.h,
	libavogadro/src/tools/periodictablegv.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/tools/CMakeLists.txt,
	libavogadro/src/tools/drawtool.h: Added a new periodic table based
	upon the QGraphicsView. Ported the draw tool to use it.

	* -libavogadro/src/tools/periodictabledialog.*: Removed the old
	periodic table dialog.

2007-12-04  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* libavogadro/*, avogadro/*: Update headers using script based on
	fixkdeincludes. Removes a *huge* pile of un-needed #include
	statments in both *.h and *.cpp files. Should improve compilation
	time.

2007-12-04  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* avogadro/src/extrentions/: Added constraints dialog (see mailing
	list).

2007-12-03  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/autoopttool.cpp: Added IsSetupNeeded check to
	increase performance.

2007-12-01  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/engine.h, libavogadro/src/tool.h,
	libavogadro/src/glwidget.h, libavogadro/src/painter.h,
	libavogadro/src/glpainter.h, libavogadro/src/povpainter.h: More
	enhancements for the documentation of these classes.

	* libavogadro/src/povpainter.*: Moved empty implementations to the
	header to show more clearly that they do not do anything.

2007-12-01  Tim Vandermeersch  <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* avogadro/src/extentions/forcefieldextension.*: Added a progress bar
	to Systematic Rotor Search. Random and Weighted Rotor Search still
	need to be split in OB.

2007-11-30  Marcus D. Hanwell  <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/debugengine.cpp: Small fix to use painter.

	* -libavogadro/src/engines/axesengine.*,
	libavogadro/src/engines/CMakeLists.txt, libavogadro/src/glwidget.*,
	avogadro/src/settingsdialog.*, avogadro/src/mainwindow.*: Moved the
	axes engine to the GLWidget where it belongs. Added a global
	configuration option for it too.

	* libavogadro/src/camera.h, libavogadro/src/color.h,
	libavogadro/src/engine.h: Fixed up the documentation a little.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/ringengine.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/engines/ringsettingswidget.ui: Make the rings opaque by
	default.

	* avogadro/src/mainwindow.h: Fix the API documentation title.

2007-11-30  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* libavogadro/src/primitiveitemmodel.cpp: Add back missing
	functionality from MoleculeTreeView. Atoms now have elements,
	residues have names and numbers, etc. May need further tinkering.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/drawtool.cpp: Minor changes to SMILES
	text.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/autoopttool.cpp: Remove "OBPatched"
	ifdefs. These are now all supported in OB-2.2.

	* libavogadro/src/residuecolor.[h,cpp]: New class to color based
	on Jmol "amino" residue colors.

	* libavogadro/src/color.h, libavogadro/src/elementcolor.h: Updates
	missing in yesterday's commit. Include a settings widget for
	expansion in subclasses.

2007-11-29  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* libavogadro/src/color.[h,cpp]: Make into a cleaner base class
	for custom color maps. Add a name() property to return the
	user-visible name of the color scheme.

	* libavogadro/src/elementcolor.[h,cpp]: New subclass for the
	default scheme.

	* libavogadro/src/engine.[h,cpp]: Revise colorMap() routines to
	pass pointers to preserve subclasses.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/*.cpp: Fix engines to use new colorMap
	support, including fallback between custom (i.e., per-engine) and
	global color maps. Lift color maps outside of loops for improved
	performance.

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.[h,cpp]: Add support for adding a
	global, custom color map for primitives. By default, falls back to
	the ElementColor scheme (i.e., color each atom by the element type).

	* libavogadro/src/painterdevice.h, libavogadro/src/povpainter.h:
	Add PainterDevice wrapping of the GLWidget colorMap, as above.

2007-05-29 Tim Vandermeersch <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/drawtool.*: DrawTool now allows you to
	generate molecules from smiles and place them in the GLWidget.

2007-05-29 Tim Vandermeersch <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/drawtool.*: Added a QLineEdit and QPushButton
	to generate 3D structures from the draw tool. Geoff and I talked about
	this before. But I don't know how to get access to the molecule from
	DrawTool::gen3D()?

2007-05-28 Tim Vandermeersch <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* avogadro/src/extentions/forcefieldextention.cpp: Changed MMF94 to
	MMFF94 (otherwise MMFF94 is not usable...)

2007-11-28  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/ribbonengine.*,
	libavogadro/src/engines/ribbonsettingswidget.ui: Removed the opacity
	slider for now. Also added in a new display type - lines. Renders
	cylinders between points and spheres at each point.

2007-11-27  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/glpainter.cpp: Optimised some of the drawing
	functions to help when drawing large molecules.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/wireengine.cpp: Optmised the bond drawing,
	only use multiLines when the bond order is greater than one.

2007-11-26  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/painter.h, libavogadro/src/glpainter.*,
	libavogadro/src/povpainter.h: Added new drawTriangle function that
	takes a normal as the fourth argument.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/ringengine.cpp: Calculate a normal and use it
	for the whole ring - improved lighting with no artifacts in each ring,
	still issues around turning points.

	* libavogadro/src/camera.*, libavogadro/src/povpainter.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/glpainter.cpp, libavogadro/src/tools/navigate.cpp,

	transformed axis functions and ported the existing code.

2007-11-20  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* avogadro/src/extensions/selectextension.cpp: Renamed extension
	for SMARTS selection. Added support for new options, such as
	invert selection. (More to come later, e.g., atom selection by
	name, residue by name, etc.)

2007-11-19  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/glpainter.cpp: Improvements to the drawTriangle
	function - generate valid normals for the triangles.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/CMakeLists.txt,
	libavogadro/src/engines/polygonengine.*: Added a new polygon engine.
	Render certain structures as polygons.

2007-11-19  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* libavogadro/src/glpainter.cpp: Refinement of multiple bonds in
	wireframe view.

2007-11-18  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* libavogadro/src/painter.h, libavogadro/src/glpainter.h,
	libavogadro/src/povpainter.h, libavogadro/src/glpainter.cpp: Add
	drawMultiLine method for wireframe multiple bonds.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/wireengine.h,
	libavogadro/src/engines/wireengine.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/engines/wiresettingswidget.ui:
	Add multiple bond indications for wireframe render engine.
	(Still needs some refinement, particularly triple bonds.)

2007-11-17  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/labelsettingswidget.ui,
	libavogadro/src/engines/ribbonengine.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/engines/spheresettingswidget.ui,
	libavogadro/src/engines/ringsettingswidget.ui,
	libavogadro/src/engines/ribbonsettingswidget.ui: Added spacers to the
	engine configuration dialogs.

2007-11-16  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/color.*, libavogadro/src/glpainter.cpp: Added a new
	OpenGL material that should work better with the ring engine.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/bsdyengine.*,
	libavogadro/src/engines/bsdysettingswidget.ui: Added check box to show
	higher order bonds or not.

2007-11-13  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/ribbonengine.*: Updated so that we now have
	multiple chain colours!

	* libavogadro/src/engines/ringengine.*,
	libavogadro/src/engines/CMakeLists.txt: Added new ring engine, renders
	ring structures. Transparency is not working yet.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/ringengine.*,
	libavogadro/src/engines/CMakeLists.txt,
	libavogadro/src/engines/ringsettingswidget.ui: Added opacity slider,
	transparency now working.

2007-11-11  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/painterdevice.h, libavogadro/src/povpainter.h,
	libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp: Exposed the loaded Molecule to the
	PainterDevice.

	* libavogadro/src/painter.h, libavogadro/src/povpainter.h,
	libavogadro/src/glpainter.h: Added the drawTriangle function.

2007-11-10  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* avogadro/src/mainwindow.cpp (copy, exportGraphics): Embed MDL
	molfile and SMILES data in exported graphics. Should allow PNG
	files to be read back in via Open Babel 2.2.

2007-11-06  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>

	* avogadro/libavogadro/src/engines/ribbonengine.*: Added ability to
	set the ribbon radius, also tried to add transparency - not working
	for me here.

	* libavogadro/src/glpainter.cpp: Added some extra calculations so that
	the tube shouldn't be flattened and also has a defined radius. More
	tuning has really improved the render speed - thanks to Thomas Margraf
	for providing an example which inspired what I did here.

2007-11-05  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/glpainter.cpp: Now filled with NURBS goodness.
	Still needs quite a bit of tuning and testing but visually improved.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/ribbonengine.cpp: Modifications to work
	with the new GLPainter.

2007-11-02  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>
	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp: Updated the setMolecule function to
	call setPrimitives for each engine at the end of molecule loading,
	should make our molecule loading more efficient.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/ribbonengine.*: Reimplemented the
	setPrimitives function due to changes in molecule loading.

2007-11-01  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/labelengine.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/engines/labelsettingswidget.ui: Updated the label
	engineto label atoms by residue name and number and bonds by their
	order. Feature request 1820686 and 1824338. Also added partial charge
	labelling for atoms, feature request 1824337.

2007-10-31  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/ribbonengine.*: Improvements to the ribbon
	code so that it caches the chain and updates it if the molecule is
	changed.

2007-10-24  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/ribbonengine.cpp: Improve the ribbon engine
	to render multiple chains correctly and not crash when there is no
	chain.

2007-10-24  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/painter.h, libavogadro/src/glpainter.h,
	libavogadro/src/povpainter.h: Modified the drawSpline signature to use
	QVector and take a radius.

	* libavogadro/src/glpainter.cpp: Added the necessary code to draw a
	cubic spline. Uses cylinder right now - this needs improving to fix
	the discontinuities.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/ribbonengine.cpp: Find the CA atoms that
	make up the backbone of the biological structures. Then draw this back
	bone as a cubic spline tube.

2007-10-17  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/ribbonengine.cpp: Added routine to pick out
	the CA atoms of the residue backbone. Draw cylinders between the CA
	atoms. Next step is to draw a smoothed tube between them.

2007-08-20  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/glwidget.*: Added the computeClickedPrimitive/
	Atom/Bond functions to the GLWidget class as these functions have been
	used in	several tools and are quite generic. Fixed regression with bond
	picking.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/manipulatetool.*,
	libavogadro/src/tools/bondcentrictool.*,
	libavogadro/src/tools/navigatetool.*: Ported to use the new
	computeClicked*	functions in GLWidget and removed the local
	implementations of them.

2007-08-19  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/navigate.*: Added a new navigation class with
	static member functions to perform the navigation functions common to
	three tools right now and possibly more in future.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/CMakeLists.txt,
	libavogadro/src/tools/navigatetool.*,
	libavogadro/src/tools/bondcentrictool.*
	libavogadro/src/tools/selectrotatetool.*: Ported the tools to use the
	new Navigate class and removed all duplicated code this has now been
	moved.

2007-08-18  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/clickmeasuretool.cpp: Added units to the output.
	Also added the display of the angle sector under consideration with the
	current selection of atoms.

2007-08-13  Donald E. Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp: Refactored clearSelection to clearSelected
	in order to preserve some clarity.  Needs another refactor at sometime to
	clearSelectedPrimitives I think.

2007-08-10  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/navigatotool.cpp: Added visual representation
	of atom centred translation. Needs extra features adding to the
	painter and porting, as does the previous visual feedback.

2007-08-08  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/navigatotool.*: Add visual representation of
	atom centred molecule rotation. Benoit and I worked on this feature in
	the Versailles gardens in France, all credit to Benoit for figuring
	out the maths and OpenGL. Open up modifiers to all - we always
	planned to add this for all architectures. Alt seems to be taken in
	KDE for Window movement though - possibly need an alternate.

	* libavogadro/src/povpainter.*: Added multiCylinder support thanks to
	help from Benoit with the maths. Also tweaked the default material
	parameters in order to improve the look of default renders. Still need
	to improve the translation from OpenGL to POV-Ray coords.

2007-08-06  Donald E. Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp: GLWidget is not initialized until it is
	actually called to render.  This hopefully fixes a race condition that
	existed somewhere with makeCurrent().  Not sure why this was happening but
	I believe it had something to do with the fact that we were calling
	->run() within the constructor and we don't know what magic TT is doing
	behind the scenes.

	* libavogadro/src/primitiveitemmodel.h,
	libavogadro/src/primitiveitemmodel.cpp: there was an issue with the engine
	views when deleting certain atoms which has been fixed.  Basically the
	model needs to notify the view that it's just taking from the end of the
	list but has reordered the contents (just the way we happen to change
	things in the engines).


2007-07-03  Donald E. Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/autorotatetool.*: Automatically start rotation
	after the mouse is released when modifying feedback through the OpenGL
	widget.

2007-06-24  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/drawtool.cpp (DrawTool::mousePress): Fix
	bugs with "alchemy" mode -- clicking on an atom to change the
	element. PR#1741653 and PR#1720879.

	* avogadro/src/editcommands.[h,cpp]: Support for selecting new
	atoms when pasting. Fixes PR#1739837.

	* avogadro/src/mainwidnow.cpp: Pass along the widget when creating
	a paste command. Fix minor crashes when copy/cut with selected
	bonds. (Now we can select more than just atoms).

2007-06-21  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* avogadro/src/extensions/h2methylextension.cpp: New extension for
	"sculpting" hydrogen atoms to methyl groups. Works also on
	selected hydrogens.

	* avogadro/src/extensions/hydrogens*: Fix PR#1739841. Only add or
	remove hydrogens for selected atoms if some atoms are selected.

2007-06-19  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp, libavogadro/src/engines/*.cpp:
	Initialise the painter at the start of the GLWidget render function,
	removed all calls to painter begin and end from the engines.

2007-06-19  Donald E. Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* avogadro/src/extensions/ghemicalextension.cpp: Added threading so that a
	progress dialog is displayed.

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.*: Added ::radius function to the GLWidget that
	way tools and engines only need to ask the GLWidget the radius rather than
	actually going through all engines on their own.  Also, engines more
	accurately give radius.

	* libavogadro/src/engine.*: updated ::radius function to take the GLWidget
	as a parameter.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/*: updated engines to not maintain an internal
	pointer to the GLWidget that was last called.

2007-06-19  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp (updateGeometry): Initial attempt
	at updating geometry based on unit cell parameters. This *seems*
	like the correct approach, but I have not checked with Benoit or
	fully tested. This tracks PR#1739844.

2007-06-19  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/navigatetool.cpp: Updated tooltip to reflect
	current behaviour of this tool.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/manipulatetool.cpp: Changed translation to the
	left mouse button and rotation to the right as suggested by Donald and
	Geoff. It does seem more intuitive despite not matching navigate tool.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/autorotatetool.*: Added the ability to
	initiate rotation using mouse movements. Left for x/y, middle for z.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/sphereengine.*,
	libavogadro/src/engines/spheresettingswidget.ui: Removed the skeleton
	rendering functions - use the other engines thanks to changes in
	engine rendering order made by Donald. Much simpler implementation
	that can use any engine for the backbone now.

2007-06-18  Donald E. Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp: added second pass (trasnparent)
	render.

	* libavogadro/src/engine.*: added some engine flags for
	transparency atoms, bonds, molecules so that the glwidget
	has a better idea of the capabilities of the engines.  also added
	the transparencyDepth relative to others.  this needs a conceptual
	update just because i don't think it's intuitive.  if people define
	theirs higher than other engines they get priority.  i still believe
	this should be dependent on the ::radius response for the specific
	primitive type we're trying to compare.

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.*: engines are now sorted on load
	based on their flags and their transparencyDepth.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/*: added flags and depth stuff.

2007-06-17  Donald E. Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.*: Fixed a bug in mass selection where
	the pointer was going past the end of the buffer.  Had to make sure
	our pointer stays sane.

	* libavogadro/src/primitive.*: Removed old selection code.

	* libavogadro/src/selectrotate.cpp: Updated so that if there are
	multiple engines, the toggling of selection only happens once per
	primitive.

	* avogadro/src/extensions/gamessinputdialog.cpp: Fixed bug 1720467.

2007-06-17  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* avogadro/src/mainwindow.*: Remove quit() event -- Mac clients
	should receive a closeEvent for every window (advice from
	Trolltech).

	* avogadro/src/extensions/unitcell*: Add support for controlling
	unit cell dimensions and angles. Add a warning if the molecule
	does not yet have a unit cell record -- extension will suggest a
	possible box dimenison.

2007-06-16  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/axesengine.cpp: Improvements to the axes
	engine rendering - all axes should be of equal length now.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/sphereengine.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/engines/spheresettingswidget.ui: Some improvements to
	the rendering code and the setup widget, as suggested by Benoit.

	* libavogadro/src/painter.cpp, avogadro/src/settingsdialog.ui:
	Added some higher detail levels, probably only useful on accelerated
	systems. Kept the default level at 2.

2007-06-15  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/autorotatetool.*: Added a start/stop button and a reset button to the config widget for the auto rotate tool.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/manipulatetool.*: Added undo/redo support to
	the manipulation tool.

	* cmake/modules/FindOpenBabel2.cmake: Added more verbosity to the cmake
	messages about the required version.

2007-06-14  Carsten Niehaus <cniehaus@kde.og>

	* Require Qt 4.3.0 at least

2007-06-14  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>

	* avogadro/src/extensions/unitcellparamdialog.cpp: Small fix to close
	the dialog when cancel is clicked.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/selectrotatetool.cpp: Fixed bond selection bug
	when using a selection box.

2007-06-13  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* avogadro/src/extensions/unitcell*: New extension to control
	display of unit cells along a, b, and c axes.

	* avogadro/src/mainwindow.cpp: Add a small random vector offset to
	pasted molecules, so they do not fall on top of each other. (Best
	solution would be to mirror drawing programs, a small increasing
	offset with every paste.)

	* libavogadro/src/tools/drawtool.cpp: Fix minor bug with periodic
	table widget loosing focus.

2007-06-13  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/CMakeLists.txt,
	libavogadro/src/tools/autorotatetool.*: Added new auto rotation tool.
	The scene can be rotated about the x, y	and z axes. Modified to allow
	both positive and negative rotations.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/navigatetool.cpp: Corrected incorrect tooltip.

2007-06-12  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/camera.*: Added transformedAxis functions for x, y
	and z.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/CMakeLists.txt,
	libavogadro/src/engines/axesengine.*: Added new axes engine. It renders
	the x, y and z axes in the bottom corner of the display. The orientation
	of the axes reflects the scenes orientation.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/sphereengine.cpp: Two pass rendering of the
	transparent VdW spheres to remove internal sphere elements and improve
	the look of the rendered scene.

2007-06-11  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/labelengine.*: Added support for bond labels.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/bsdyengine.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/engines/stickengine.cpp: Improved the radius function
	to return bond radii.

	* libavogadro/src/color.*: Added setAlpha function to set the
	transparency but not change colour.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/CMakeLists.txt,
	libavogadro/src/engines/sphereengine.*,
	libavogadro/src/engines/spheresettingswidget.ui: Added configuration
	options to the VdW engine. Added transparency effects to the VdW
	rendering. When enabled a ball and stick rendering is done inside the
	VdW rendering.

2007-06-05  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* .:  Update EngineConfigurationWidget to EngineSetupWidget and updated
	file names and all references in the project.  Updated CMakeFiles.

2007-06-13  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/periodictable*: New widget with slim
	periodic table to pick arbitrary elements.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/drawtool.cpp: Use it.

2007-05-26  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/tools/manipulatetool.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/tools/navigatetool.cpp: Use left mouse button for
	rotation and right mouse button for translation.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/bsdyengine.cpp,
	libavogadro/src/tools/selectrotatetool.cpp: Fix a bug where the 0
	indexed bond is not selectable. Some cleanup.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/stickengine.*: Added bond selection support.
	Refactored and cleaned up in some places.

	* libavogadro/src/engines/sphereengine.cpp: Improved description.

2007-05-25  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* avogadro/src/extension.h, avogadro/src/mainwindow.cpp:
	Add Extension::menuPath() which defines menus and submenus for
	extensions. Default is to use "&Tools" -- existing Tools menu.

	* avogadro/src/extensions/ghemicalextension.h: Use above for a
	"Molecular Mechanics" submenu for all actions.

2007-05-25  Marcus D. Hanwell <marcus@cryos.org>

	* libavogadro/src/engines/bsdyengine.*: Refactored to use the
	overloaded render functions. Added features to push the bond type and
	name to enable bond selection. Added selected bond highlighting.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/selectrotatetool.cpp: Added some initial support
	for selecting bonds with clicks and selection boxes.

	* libavogadro/src/tools/manipulatetool.cpp: Added checks for primitive
	type before doing any manipulation - previously assumed all selected
	items were atoms.

	* libavogadro/src/global.h: Added SEL_BOND_EXTRA_RADIUS for selected
	bond rendering in the engines.

2007-05-24  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* avogadro/src/application.cpp: Fix bug 1717423 -- Mac interface
	fix for opening files from Finder.

	* avogadro/src/mainwindow.*: Mac interface fixes. Duplicate menu
	and toolbar actions for  new, open, save, close, quit. Remove
	icons from menu items. Fix bug 1720872: don't close the last
	MainWindow, hide it and disable menu items. Restore upon open or
	new.

	* avogadro/src/extensions/smartsextension.*: Remove undo/redo
	support. Selections cannot be preserved against views, so there's
	no good way to undo a selection change.

2007-05-23  Donald E. Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.*: Did a bunch of API cleanup.  I know i know.
	How you guys loath my long function names.  Moved from ::selection to
	::selectedPrimitives.  Now have ::setSelected and ::isSelect.  Thanks
	KDevelop for nice refactoring.  This naming method follows more of the Qt
	style "view" naming conventions (ie ::selectedItems).
	* .: Fixed a few compiler warnings.

2007-05-22  Donald E. Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* avogadro/src/enginetabwidget.*: Now uses a .ui file to design the
	widget.  this is much easier.

	* avogadro/src/primitivetreeview.*: Added the PrimitiveTreeView class as a
	helper class for displaying PrimitiveItemModels.  Just looks a bit
	prettier.

	* libavogadro/src/primitivelist.*: Added the ::contains(Primitive *)
	operator for checking if a primitive is already in the list.

	* .: Lots of other stuff for doing selective rendering.

2007-05-22  Geoffrey Hutchison  <babel@geoffhutchison.net>

	* avogadro/src/mainwindow.cpp: Fix bug 1722691. Show preferences
	in the correct spot on Mac.

2007-05-21  Donald E. Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* .: Refactored PrimitiveQueue -> PrimitiveList.  Within the class renamed
	::primitiveQueue to ::subList which returns a subList based on type.
	Fixed changes due to refactoring in various files.

	* libavogadro/src/primitive.h: Fixed compiler warnings.
	* libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp: Fixed compiler warnings.
	* libavogadro/src/color.cpp: Added virtual deconstructor and reformatted.
	* libavogadro/src/engines/bsdyengine.cpp: Fixed compiler warnings.
	* avogadro/src/enginelistview.cpp: Cleaned commented code and fixed bug
	caused by previous approach.

2007-05-18 01:41  Tim Vandermeersch <tim.vandermeersch@gmail.com>

	* avogadro/src/extentions/ghemicalextention.h,
	avogadro/src/extentions/ghemicalextention.cpp: Added "Setup
	Force Field " dialog, "Calculate Energy" and "Rotor Search".

	* avogadro/src/extentions/forcefielddialog.h,
	avogadro/src/extentions/forcefielddialog.cpp,
	avogadro/src/extentions/forcefielddialog.ui: force field setup
	dialog. (I had to call uic-qt4 manually, something wrong with
	the makefile?)

	* .: Tagging 0.1.0 combined release

2007-05-13 18:14  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Few UI bugs and removed debugging line that was unneeded.

2007-05-13 14:01  Marcus D. Hanwell <cryos@gentoo.org>

	* : Fixed small bug with the zoom manipulation, not sure how that
	  crept in there ;)

2007-05-13 13:34  Marcus D. Hanwell <cryos@gentoo.org>

	* : Fix for bug 1717975 - molecules and residues now behave more
	  intuitively across
	  views. Still may not be perfect but a definite improvement.

2007-05-13 09:36  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : fix the preceding fix :)

2007-05-13 09:33  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : Make a ugly hack so that the labelengine works with
	  Sphereengine and
	  Sticksengine correctly.

2007-05-13 09:15  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : Close bug 1717985; some simplification in TextRenderer.

2007-05-12 23:52  Marcus D. Hanwell <cryos@gentoo.org>

	* : Added function to easily determine if a Primitive is selected
	  in the GLWidget.
	  Modified the toggleSelected function to behave as expected with
	  multiple views.
	  Found and fixed a subtle crash in the engines when radius was
	  called before
	  render and ported all engines to render correctly with multiple
	  views.

2007-05-12 19:03  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Extension cleanup. Base Extension class is not QObject, but
	  extensions are.

2007-05-12 17:44  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : fix bug where the selection rectangle was not drawn because of
	  back-face
	  culling. I think I introduced this bug a while ago, in an
	  "optimization".

2007-05-12 17:43  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Pass a GLWidget to extensions (so selection can be modified,
	  auto-rotate, etc.)
	  Add example SMARTS selection extension -- select atoms by SMARTS
	  pattern.

2007-05-12 17:40  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Update version to 0.1.0

2007-05-12 17:34  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Updated documentation.

	  Removed dependancy on 4.3 (make sure you do editing of .ui files
	  with designer of qt4.2)

	  Added documentation.

	  Updated copyright information on all files.

	  There is now a Doxyfileext which generates external docs.

2007-05-12 17:18  Marcus D. Hanwell <cryos@gentoo.org>

	* : Fix inconsistencies between what is drawn and what the
	  manipulate tool does
	  when using multiple views. The other engines still need their
	  behaviour to be
	  fixed.

2007-05-12 15:23  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : Minor API improvements; make use of these at various places;
	  close bug
	  1717437 in clickmeasuretool.

2007-05-12 13:59  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : fix bug in dynamic-bs where the separation between the two
	  colors of a bond was not made at the middle of the bond. Also
	  don't
	  draw the portion of the bond that's inside the sphere.

2007-05-12 13:49  Marcus D. Hanwell <cryos@gentoo.org>

	* : Added the tilt ability to the middle mouse press - tilt
	  selected atoms.

2007-05-12 13:29  Carsten Niehaus <carsten.niehaus@gmail.com>

	* : Markus says since the commit r386 we depend on Qt 4.3

2007-05-12 13:27  Marcus D. Hanwell <cryos@gentoo.org>

	* : Fix a bug with atoms selected using the selection box.
	  Performed some clean up
	  in the selectrotatetool code.

2007-05-12 08:52  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : safety/performance fixes in the textrenderer. in particular,
	  avoid large
	  arithmetic operations involving GLubytes: too risky wrt overflow!

2007-05-12 02:21  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Add support for setting the number of unit cells to display.
	  Not exposed in the user interface, but
	  it's now in the library. Just need to build the window for the
	  extension (after this beta release).

2007-05-12 02:18  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Add "hand" icon for manipulate tool.

2007-05-12 02:16  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Add "select all" and "select none" edit menu actions.

2007-05-11 22:58  Marcus D. Hanwell <cryos@gentoo.org>

	* : Added some shortcut keys for the tools. These may not be
	  optimal and probably
	  need further discussion. Also added the drawing of the selection
	  centroid sphere
	  for the manipulate tool.

2007-05-11 21:34  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Support for cut/copy of just selected atoms.

2007-05-11 20:20  Marcus D. Hanwell <cryos@gentoo.org>

	* : Added selection manipulation for the zoom function too - move
	  selections in to
	  and out of the display.

2007-05-11 20:16  Marcus D. Hanwell <cryos@gentoo.org>

	* : Comment out the atom manipulation code - moved to
	  manipulatetool. Should be
	  removed once the code in manipulatetool is better tested.

2007-05-11 20:04  Marcus D. Hanwell <cryos@gentoo.org>

	* : Adapted the methods implemented by Geoff in the
	  selectrotatetool source. Now
	  translation (LMB) and rotation (RMB) of selected atoms works.
	  Currently uses
	  the selection list maintained by GLWidget.

2007-05-11 19:45  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Improve behavior when opening files while launching on Mac.

2007-05-11 17:24  Marcus D. Hanwell <cryos@gentoo.org>

	* : Initial version of the manipulation tool. Currently only
	  operates on single
	  atoms. Currently the left mouse button translates the atom
	  position in x and y.
	  The middle mouse button moves the atom into and out of the screen
	  (zoom). This
	  tool needs its own icon.

2007-05-11 03:52  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Fix quit action on Mac.

2007-05-11 03:05  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Add initial cut support, as well as undo/redo for clear.

2007-05-11 01:17  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Updated indenting in CMakeLists.txt, corrected some comments in
	  sphere.h,
	  updated Doxygen configuration.

2007-05-10 20:53  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : remove some useless OpenGL commands. Make sure
	  GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB
	  is defined.

2007-05-10 20:07  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : some cleanup in TextRenderer

2007-05-10 20:00  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Remove old bsengine code

2007-05-10 19:52  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : add method needed by cryos (and needed anyway):
	  Camera::backTransformedZAxis()

2007-05-10 18:41  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Add some initial support for "selection modes" and tracking
	  selected atoms
	  (in the GLWidget). Probably needs some work.

2007-05-10 18:16  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : Fix small mistake in TextRenderer. As a result:
	  better visual quality for the outlining effect !

2007-05-10 18:10  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : Fix the bug where the text was misrendered as blank rectangles.
	  You know what? after all it _was_ a bug in my own code! I was
	  using
	  GL_TEXTURE_2D with non-rectangular, non-power-of-2 textures.
	  Using
	  GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB instead did the trick (btw: we need to
	  add this define to global.h in case glext.h doesn't provide it).
	  Apparently some drivers were more liberal than others in that
	  respect,
	  which is why the bug only showed with some drivers, giving the
	  wrong
	  impression that it was a driver issue. I closed the bug report --
	  with
	  apologies -- at bugs.freedesktop.org.

2007-05-09 21:49  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : remove outdated #include that were breaking compilation. Sorry
	  rbraith
	  :)

2007-05-09 19:56  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : Move the Sphere, Cylinder and TextRenderer to a internal/
	  subdirectory,
	  don't expose them publicly. These classes are only used by the
	  Painter
	  class.
	  Also replace tabs with 2 spaces in the CMakeLists.txt files, to
	  be
	  consistent with the indenting style of the source code.

2007-05-09 19:24  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Make sure to link against extension.cpp for support on Mac.

2007-05-09 19:00  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : In TextRenderer: quality improvements, API changes, indentation
	  fixing,
	  and most importantly, documentation (both API and internal code
	  comments).
	  Also fix indentation in Sphere.

2007-05-08 16:40  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : my biggest commit ever :)
	  - add TextRenderer class to replace QGLWidget::renderText.
	  Indeed, we
	  have to admit that even in recent versions of Qt such as 4.2.3
	  and
	  4.3-b1, renderText is still very slow; moreover it doesn't do
	  outlined
	  text, and emulating outlined text with multiple calls made
	  rendering
	  incredibly slow. So let me introduce this new TextRenderer class.
	  Its
	  selling points are:
	  -- shadowed/outlined text with good visual quality
	  -- very fast: enabling the label-engine no longer has a big
	  impact on
	  the frame rate; there should not be a need to disable text while
	  moving
	  after all!
	  -- 2D text that's guaranteed to stay always on top (closes the
	  bug where
	  atoms could hide the output of the debug-engine).
	  - let Painter have a TextRenderer and expose its functionality
	  - move the projection/unprojection methods from GLWidget to
	  Camera. let
	  Camera remember its projection matrix. Result: the project() and
	  unProject() methods are now much faster and also more solid.
	  - make use of all that new stuff everywhere (incl. tools and
	  engines)
	  - fix position of text in clickmeasuretool

2007-05-08 09:34  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : In GLWidget, make the Camera live as a pointer and let
	  GLWidget::camera() return this pointer instead of a reference.
	  Adapt the
	  rest of the code to that change.

2007-05-08 02:03  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Added improved "manipulate" rotate thanks to Benoit. Shift +
	  left mouse. Much cleaner rotation.

2007-05-07 22:43  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Small bug fix for opening windows. Have to check the UndoStack.
	  If it is in a
	  clean state we know there are no modifications.

2007-05-07 22:32  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Update Extensions to separate instances per MainWindow.

	  Added true SDI functionality. For more info see
	  http://developer.kde.org/documentation/standards/kde/style/basics/windows.html
	  http://developer.kde.org/documentation/standards/kde/style/basics/quitclose.html

	  This should fix our Mac errors.

2007-05-07 19:26  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Copy/paste now prefers MDL molfile mimetype (ensures bond
	  orders, etc. copied)
	  Paste will now select atoms pasted for automatic manipulation.

2007-05-07 18:22  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Initial "manipulate mode" for select tool.
	  Hold down the shift key: left button rotates (needs work) right
	  translates

2007-05-07 10:14  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Added the settings dialogs to Engines.

	  Modified the preexisting toolSettings interface to return a 0 if
	  there is no
	  settings available for the tool. This is done to mimic the
	  engines settings
	  interface and it is done in the engines settings so that we know
	  if we should
	  create a new window or not. It is better than testing against
	  null QWidgets or
	  whatever the alternative would be.

	  Also added GLWidget::setStable(bool) and GLWidget::isStable() to
	  see if the
	  GLWidget is in an unstable state. This would occur as the result
	  of some tool
	  setting it.

2007-05-07 09:47  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : Fix compile error (extra closing parenthesis -- sorry!)
	  Tweak detail level of spheres.

2007-05-07 08:19  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : rework class Cylinder; make Painter able to draw Cylinders;
	  make use of
	  that in all engines; also change Tools so they no longer have
	  their own
	  Cylinders/Spheres and use Painter instead.

2007-05-07 03:07  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Minor fixes. Remove "select all" (not ready) and fudge "cut"
	  with current copy() code.

2007-05-07 02:25  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Add initial support for copy commands (includes copy to text,
	  image, chemical/x-xyz).
	  Still needs work tomorrow.

2007-05-06 20:35  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : make use of Painter to draw spheres in all engines.
	  Introduce SEL_ATOM_EXTRA_RADIUS constant to control the radius of
	  selection highlighting spheres (added to the atom's radius).

2007-05-06 18:43  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : Fix Z-fighting (nothing related to dragonball Z) issue. cryos:
	  i hope
	  this fixes the visual artifacts you were getting

2007-05-06 16:59  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : Introduce Painter class and global quality setting. Currently
	  it can
	  only paint spheres. Make bsdyengine use it.

2007-05-06 16:56  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : implement level 0 as a octahedron, d-pointerify, and many
	  simplifications

2007-05-06 10:09  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : Fix typo in Ross's name. Sorry!

2007-05-06 00:27  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Added operator+= and copy constructor to the Molecule class.

	  Added pasting operation. Currently only works with cartesian
	  coordinates. It
	  is setup to work with Mime data but i pick the default text case
	  (assumed to be
	  cartesian coordinates).

2007-05-05 19:04  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Add hooks for options dialog for engines.

2007-05-05 11:49  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : Draw outlined text in labelengine, for readibility on all
	  backgrounds.
	  Had to change the depthFunc from GL_LESS to GL_LEQUAL. Hope that
	  doesn't
	  break anything.
	  This is very slow so I propose that text should be hidden while
	  moving
	  the camera with the mouse, to get smoother movement. That
	  suggests the
	  following: in Engine, we could have renderOpaque,
	  renderTransparent and
	  renderText. What do you think? Tools would inform the GLWidget
	  that they
	  are moving the view using callbacks GLWidget::beginMoveCamera()
	  and
	  GLWidget::endMoveCamera().

2007-05-04 23:14  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Fix compile problems with radius() function

2007-05-04 22:26  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Added radius function to stick engine.

2007-05-04 20:31  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Add support for classes of color maps (subclasses of Color).
	  This includes setting a color map for any engine.
	  (e.g., color by element, color by atom type, color by reside...)

2007-05-04 18:33  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : fix position of label in the labelengine (now the label is
	  always placed on top of the atom, from the camera's point of
	  view)
	  however there remains an issue caused by the fact that we still
	  don't
	  make sure all opaque objects have been drawn *before* transparent
	  objects are drawn.

2007-05-04 16:10  Marcus D. Hanwell <cryos@gentoo.org>

	* : Removed d-pointer stuff as it is not required for tools - see
	  mailing list.

2007-05-04 11:16  Marcus D. Hanwell <cryos@gentoo.org>

	* : Improved the label engine to use the radius method an so labels
	  can be seen
	  using the sphere engine now. Still needs work on label placement.

2007-05-04 10:04  Marcus D. Hanwell <cryos@gentoo.org>

	* : Updated visual effects in NaviateTool to cover all atom centred
	  operations.
	  After discussion with Benoit added d-pointer to NavigateTool too.

2007-05-04 07:41  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : fix #including in tools and engines. In particular, don't
	  include the
	  meta-header <QtGui> when the much smaller <QtPlugin> is enough.
	  Also
	  fix comment in debugengine.

2007-05-04 07:28  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : fix copyright lines in debug engine

2007-05-04 07:00  Carsten Niehaus <carsten.niehaus@gmail.com>

	* : -- I moved the FindFoo instructions in the toplevel
	  CMakeLists.txt. I see
	  no reason why we should check for it twice...

	  -- We now officially require Qt 4.2.0 (set(QT_MIN_VERSION)).
	  Benoit told
	  me that 4.1 is totally broken wrt to something in QtGl and all
	  developers are using 4.2 anyway. Before we we just looking for
	  "Qt4"
	  which would even have worked for 4.0-beta I think!

2007-05-04 06:54  Carsten Niehaus <carsten.niehaus@gmail.com>

	* : Update the installation instructions

2007-05-04 06:52  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : restoreOverrideCursor immediately whenever a failure occurs.

2007-05-04 06:36  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : in debugengine:
	  in FPS, show only 3 significant digits
	  show GLWidget height and width

2007-05-04 06:28  Carsten Niehaus <carsten.niehaus@gmail.com>

	* : This file really belong to the top level directory as you
	  cannot build
	  avo without compiling libavo

2007-05-04 06:14  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : remove _setup : Sphere::setup is clever enough to notice that
	  new_detail==old_detail and exit in that case.

	  remove some unnecessary state changes. Donald: it is possible to
	  draw
	  spheres with GL_NORMALIZE, only it's not optimally fast. But if
	  we're
	  only drawing one sphere, it's not worth the four state changes
	  enabling
	  GL_RESCALE_NORMAL instead.

2007-05-04 05:54  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : replace #defines with constants in global.h
	  remove a qDebug and other negligible cleanup

2007-05-04 03:04  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Updated Tool interface. Now there is a ::paint function which
	  gets called after
	  the engines render allowing Tools a better way to render to the
	  GLWidget (as
	  opposed to using a displayList). I updated the NavigateTool and
	  ClickMeasure
	  tool (it now shows proper colors).

	  Also added the ::radius function to the dynamic ball and stick
	  engine. As a
	  note if an atom is selected, radius(Primitive *) needs to reflect
	  that.

2007-05-03 22:57  rbraith

	* : Made the changes that Benoit recommended,
	  code in the glwidget was removed and new
	  code was put into the debug engine.

	  When the debug engine is turned on now it
	  repeatedly calles gl->update() thereby
	  makeing the glwidget constantly re-render.

	  This gives FPS a reasonably accurate value.

2007-05-03 12:28  Marcus D. Hanwell <cryos@gentoo.org>

	* : Added radius function to Engine, ported bsengine and
	  sphereengine to use the new function.

2007-05-03 09:56  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Adding the SVG for the icon.

2007-05-03 08:03  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Added template for licensing.

	  Added navigate icon taken from the crystal clear office set.

	  Added "Center View" action. There are times things are not
	  updateing the
	  glwidget's geometry info. we need to fix this so that things are
	  required to
	  call it. there is a callback from primitiveAdded /
	  primitiveUpdate /
	  primitiveRemoved that should be sufficient to set a flag that the
	  geometry data
	  needs to be updated. I'll look at this more tomorrow, tomorrow,
	  i'll love ya,
	  tomorrow, you're only a day away.

2007-05-03 06:57  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : fix the sticks-engine (lighting bug and level of detail)

2007-05-03 05:39  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Refactored classes so that extensions are named *Extension
	  (GamessExtension,
	  etc etc) Renamed source files accordingly.

2007-05-03 05:28  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : ****Big Huge Changes****

	  Undo/Redo is implemented and all of the extensions and tools have
	  been updated.
	  The interface to tools and extensions now requires that you
	  return a
	  QUndoCommand* or 0 (NULL).

	  The only important things to remember when creating QUndoCommands
	  is to make
	  sure that the state after undo is exactly how it was before you
	  performed your
	  action. Worst case you need to duplicate all the Molecule data.
	  This is
	  somewhat intense but it runs quite quickly as there are no calls
	  to NewAtom
	  meaning no callbacks.

	  There is a new class UndoSequence which is essentially a list of
	  QUndoCommands
	  which are all compiled into one. This is handy for our drawing
	  tool.

	  I apologize as i haven't had time to document any of this code.

2007-05-02 22:28  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : The last patch introduced a new tool interface to allow for
	  undo/redo. I am working on the QUndoCommand subclasses to help
	  our tools do these things.

2007-05-02 22:26  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : primtives.h was defining the Primitive class. Minor refactoring
	  that was buggin me. *sigh*.

2007-05-02 19:22  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Fix error when minimizing and restoring.

2007-05-02 08:02  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Whoops. Environment should *replace* the default.

2007-05-02 04:13  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Added new Debug Engine which lists the number of atoms and
	  molcules along with
	  the FPS. Contributed by James, Ross and Shahzad. I modified to
	  only perform
	  one division.

	  As a result there are some added hooks to GLWidget to keep track
	  of time to
	  render a scene. Hopefully we can say this is trivial.

2007-05-02 04:06  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Better unit cell crystal support.

2007-05-02 03:05  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Added stick engine

2007-05-02 02:59  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Added unit cell rendering if an OBUnitCell is present.

2007-05-01 19:08  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : tools, engines, extensions are now installed and loaded by
	  default to their
	  correct locations:
	  ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib/avogadro/{tools|engines|extensions}

	  added the define INSTALL_PREFIX to the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX path.
	  this does
	  not get installed with the other header files.

	  modified the environment variables:

	  AVOGADRO_{ENGINES|TOOLS|EXTENSIONS}

	  AVOAGDOR_EXTENSIONS was previously AVOGADRO_PLUGINS

2007-05-01 17:46  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Remove old engines to allow updated stick engine.

2007-05-01 17:30  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : fix bug found by carsten/valgrind:
	  GLWidgetPrivate::selectBufSize wasn't getting initialized.

2007-05-01 16:27  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Remove old SphereEngine code -- conflicts on
	  capitalization-sensitive file systems.
	  Clean up class names, etc. in new sphere engine.

2007-05-01 15:34  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : this is Marcus's new Sphere-engine. Thanks Marcus, the patch
	  looks
	  fine, next time don't hesitate to commit yourself (and get
	  yourself
	  a svn account if not already done).

	  CCMAIL:cryos@gentoo.org

2007-04-29 18:20  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : Fix errors (not leaks) found by valgrind:
	  "Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)"

2007-04-27 12:55  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : add another missing {} after a one-line if in my code :)

	  simplification in navigatetool

	  more clever handling of the selection buffer.
	  Instead of resizing at molecule loading (as done before), resize
	  in
	  GLWidget::hits(). To prevent too frequent resizing, add some
	  margin to
	  the buffer size.
	  The advantages are:
	  -- new approach never fails, the user may add as many atoms as he
	  likes
	  (like when doing "add hydrogens").
	  -- old approach required a large margin in order to let user add
	  atoms;
	  this is no longer needed. Old margin was 256*8=2048 ints. New
	  margin is
	  128 ints only.

2007-04-26 19:04  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Added check for correct hit type (AtomType)

2007-04-26 17:06  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : minor optimization in painting selection boxes

2007-04-26 15:56  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : -- introduce defines in global.h for the size of the small
	  selection boxes used in tools.
	  The former size, 5x5, was too small in wireframe mode
	  (selection-wise, the atoms were single
	  pixels regardless of the "point size"). We now use 9x9 boxes.
	  -- cleanup in drawtool

2007-04-26 15:39  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : cleanup in wireengine. Also revert something stupid I did
	  earlier today.

2007-04-26 15:13  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : minor cleanup in bsdyengine; only toggle client state inside
	  Sphere and Cylinder, since
	  it's not needed elsewhere.

2007-04-26 14:45  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : port memleak fix by Laurent Montel

	  CCMAIL:montel@kde.org

2007-04-26 14:39  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : fix bug in Camera::normalize. I think i introduced it in the
	  last "simplification". Oops!

2007-04-26 13:27  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : simplification in Camera::normalize(), remove qDebug()

2007-04-26 13:21  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : complete the updateGL() -> update() move

2007-04-26 13:10  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : fix bug where it was impossible to zoom out after one had
	  zoomed in to the max

2007-04-26 12:55  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : remove a qDebug().

2007-04-26 12:54  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : start with only dynbs engine enabled. That's pretty much a hack
	  as I don't really understand
	  how avogadro (the app) works. So I did it in enginelistview.
	  Sorry if that's not the right place.

	  CCMAIL:Donald Ephraim Curtis <donald-curtis@uiowa.edu>

2007-04-26 12:34  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : in wireframe engine, disable lighting and paint atoms even when
	  they are selected.
	  (instead of painting only the translucent layer)

2007-04-26 11:54  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : dynamically resize the selection buffer at molecule loading, to
	  adapt to
	  any number of atoms. At mol loading, a margin is added in case
	  the user creates
	  new atoms (current margin is for 256 new atoms).

2007-04-26 11:02  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : don't crash when GL selection fails (typically when there are
	  too many selected atoms)
	  increase value of SELECTION_BUFFER_SIZE to 4096 so that it fails
	  less often

2007-04-26 10:12  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : updateGL() -> update()

2007-04-26 09:53  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : Hey, the Navigate Tool now feels very solid, even when cruising
	  through
	  very large proteins!!

	  -simplifications and improvements in Camera wrt clipping planes
	  -reorganization in NavigateTool:
	  -- move much code to helper functions
	  -- fix at last the problem with zoom-in passing beyond the goal
	  -- swap left and right buttons
	  -- use a member glwidget pointer to reduce argument-passing.
	  the pointer is obtained from the mouse callbacks.
	  - move numeric constants to #defines in global.h

2007-04-25 16:49  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : have the camera auto-normalize after each rotation. no need to
	  explicitly
	  normalize anymore.

2007-04-25 10:24  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : Now mouse wheel is also sensitive to the atom below mouse
	  pointer.

2007-04-25 09:14  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : Solve a numerical instability issue : after a large number of
	  rotations,
	  the camera matrix got more and more corrupt, eventually resulting
	  in a blank
	  GLwidget.

	  Solved by adding method Camera::normalizeRotation(), to be called
	  after each
	  frequent rotation (typically in user input handling). Already
	  used in navigatetool
	  and selectrotatetool.

2007-04-25 08:08  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : much improved right-button movement in navigatetool.
	  Now the molecule precisely follows the mouse movement.
	  This required further tweaking of the unProject API.

2007-04-25 07:38  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : change prototype of unProject(double, double) to
	  unProject(const QPoint&).

	  This simplifies some code since this method is always being
	  called on QPoint coordinates.

2007-04-25 07:30  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : Rework API and documentataion for project/unproject,
	  const-correctify,
	  make use of class Vector3d.
	  Move to GLWidget the special unproject method from DrawTool
	  taking only
	  x and y coords and unprojecting to the plane of the mol center
	  parallel to
	  the screen. Will be useful in NavigateTool.

2007-04-25 06:57  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : fixes and simplifications in mid-button zoom.
	  No longer center on atom; instead keep atom center at
	  fixed position on screen. Centering is no longer needed since
	  right-button
	  allows to center manually. Keeping atom at fixed position is also
	  more consistent
	  with left-button rotation.

2007-04-24 18:51  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : simplifications

2007-04-24 06:44  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Renamed tool filenames to match their class names.

2007-04-24 06:25  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Updated Engine interface to recieve the GLWidget as a pointer.
	  This as opposed
	  to using the ::parent() for two reasons: 1) we can duplicate
	  GLWidgets (so that
	  they share engines) 2) we may also want to allow programs using
	  libavogadro to
	  load their own engines and pass them to the GLWidget.

	  Updated Tools so that they are named correctly. ie. DrawTool
	  SelectRotateTool
	  ... This to match the *Engine form with engines. renaming coming
	  soon.

2007-04-23 18:10  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : MainWindow now has functionality to create multiple views.
	  View->New View /
	  View->Close View.

	  GLWidget optimized functionality so that unactive GLContexts to
	  not get
	  rendered. This will need to be updated if/when we allow two views
	  to be shown
	  at once.

	  EngineListView now handles enabling and disabling engines for the
	  current
	  GLWidget. (opposed to MainWindow binding to the signals).

2007-04-23 10:35  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : cleanup and bugfixing in the navigate tool.
	  -- fix molecule-centered rotation when center is not at origin
	  -- don't recompute GL hits at every mouse move

2007-04-23 10:09  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : Fix camera bug cause by miscalculation of distance to molecule.
	  Fix
	  comment explaining how this is computed. Introduce
	  Camera::distance(Vector&) method performing this computation in
	  the
	  correct way. Make use of this new method in bsdynengine and
	  labelengine,
	  and do cleanup there. Remove method Camera::translationVector().

2007-04-23 06:29  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Added d-pointer to Cylinder class + formatting updated.

	  Primitive and Molecule now share d-pointer.

2007-04-23 00:25  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : new / open now perform correctly; ie, check for modified status
	  (handled by the
	  QMainWindow) and ask to save if changes have been made. also,
	  'new' simply
	  clears our the editor rather than creating a new window.

2007-04-22 23:13  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Updating to qt style d-ptrs.

2007-04-22 22:11  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Renamed the d pointer properties.

2007-04-22 21:47  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : more updates based off the new tool interface.

2007-04-22 21:45  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : libavogadro/src/tool.h,libavogadro/src/tool.cpp; updated
	  interface. removed
	  ::initialize() and ::cleanup() functions. Unneeded. If plugins
	  need to use
	  these functions they can attach functions to the signals of the
	  ::activateAction().

	  libavogadro/src/toolgroup.cpp; we can now use Tool::parent() to
	  get the plugin
	  which it belongs to, rather than relying on the Tool::data() to
	  do the same.

	  libavogadro/src/CMakeLists.txt; added the tool.cpp file so that
	  the tool object
	  gets compiled into libavogadro.

	  libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp; tool interface was updated.

	  Updated interface to all tools.

2007-04-20 19:06  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Add pointer icon for selectrotate tool

2007-04-20 18:59  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : libavogadro/src/tools/draw.h, libavogadro/src/tools/draw.cpp;
	  updated tooltip
	  to include how the tool works. added code to replace atoms and
	  bonds if they
	  are different. clicking on a lone atom will change it to the new
	  type..
	  drawing bonds over preexisting bonds updates them.

	  libavogadro/src/tools/clickmeasure.cpp,libavogadro/src/tools/clickmeasure.h;
	  updated tooltip to include how the tool works. renamed the tag so
	  that as you
	  select you get atom 1,2,3 rather than 0,1,2.

2007-04-20 16:21  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : libavogadro/src/engines/labelengine.cpp; push all GL attribute
	  bits and use
	  white text.

	  libavogadro/src/tools/clickmeasure.cpp; push all GL attributes,
	  give feedback
	  on initial click (marked with *0) for now.

2007-04-20 15:36  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Forgot to add my neat measure icon.

2007-04-20 01:59  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : tools/measure.qrc : forgot to add. sorry about this. resource
	  for the measure icon.

2007-04-20 00:51  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : libavogadro/src/glwidget.h libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp : added
	  unProject and
	  project functions, also fixed the ::hits function so it restore
	  the previous
	  projection and modelview matrices

	  libavogadro/src/engines/bsdyengine.cpp : fixed compiler warning

	  libavogadro/src/tools/selectrotate.cpp : free the display list

	  libavogadro/src/tools/clickmeasure.cpp
	  libavogadro/src/tools/clickmeasure.h :
	  new click to measure tool. Displays results in the GL Widget.

	  libavogadro/src/tools/CMakeLists.txt : added clickmeasure build
	  instructions

	  libavogadro/src/tools/draw.cpp libavogadro/src/tools/draw.h :
	  make use of the
	  new GLWidget::project and GLWidget::unProject functions

	  libavogadro/src/tool.h : renamed ::init to ::initialize. can't be
	  sure we
	  actually need these functions. we have the option to let the tool
	  decide what
	  initialization it needs to do by connection to the action
	  signals.

2007-04-19 18:01  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Switch to use dynamic_cast instead of qobject_cast

2007-04-19 18:00  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Namespace fixes.

2007-04-15 19:27  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Needed to use quotes instead of <>'s on the relative include.

2007-04-14 15:58  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Replaced with truly fake. Probably something happened in the
	  riggermerow<sp?>...

2007-04-14 03:05  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Fix "fake" includes.

2007-04-14 01:13  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Moving headers from src/ to include/avogadro -- two pass job.

2007-04-14 00:31  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : libavogadro/src/engines/bsdyengine.cpp,
	  libavogadro/src/engines/bsdyengine.h:
	  added dynamics for bonds.

	  libavogadro/src/cylinder.cpp, libavogadro/src/cylinder.h: when
	  detail < 0 we
	  generate a single line rather than a cylinder. Also added
	  constructor with
	  default parameter to 0.

2007-04-13 19:40  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : libavogadro/src/moleculetreeview.cpp: removed debug code

	  libavogadro/src/sphere.cpp: added constructor and cleaned up code

	  libavogadro/src/toolgroup.cpp: removed debug code

	  libavogadro/src/primitives.cpp: removed debug code

	  libavogadro/src/sphere.h: added constructor which takes as a
	  parameter the
	  detail

	  libavogadro/src/engine.h, libavogadro/src/engine.cpp : added
	  interface function
	  to inform the engine to update the primitive. This is a
	  cautionary function
	  for optimization.

	  libavogadro/src/glwidget.cpp: cleaned up the code, added use of
	  new engine
	  function.

	  libavogadro/src/engines/labelengine.cpp: added clause to not
	  label when far
	  from camera libavogadro/src/engines/bsdyengine.h,
	  libavogadro/src/engines/bsdyengine.cpp: proof of concept for
	  optimization of
	  the ball & stick engine. Added this as to not disturb the old
	  code until the
	  new code can be cleaned up. I will get around to this just
	  haven't had the
	  time to think about the best way to do it.

	  libavogadro/src/engines/bsengine.cpp: removed debug code.

	  libavogadro/src/engines/CMakeLists.txt: added bsdyengine

	  libavogadro/src/tools/CMakeLists.txt: commented test tool code.

	  libavogadro/src/tools/selectrotate.cpp: added atom::update call
	  after selection

	  libavogadro/src/tools/draw.cpp: removed debug code

2007-04-09 19:16  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Minor reorganization of BS engine to improve performance.
	  (Need to add "options" ability to set level of detail, etc.)

2007-04-09 15:01  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Renamed Mac icon to avogadro.icns

2007-04-08 22:37  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : There is build info for the measure tool in the CMakeLists.txt
	  but the code is not yet commitable. Don't know how this got
	  commited but sorry for the inconvenience.

2007-04-08 20:32  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Misspelling of 'avogadro.png'. Thanks to Steven Di Rocco for
	  bringing this to
	  our attention.

2007-04-03 17:58  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Update logo name to avogadro.png. Lets not get too lazy with
	  naming it's
	  important! atom2.png does not describe what the png is really of.

2007-04-02 15:50  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Updated PrimitiveQueue to allocate statically instead of
	  dynamically.

	  Changed PrimitiveQueue::primitiveList to return a const
	  QList<Primitive *>

	  Updated the engines to use "foreach" loops.

2007-04-02 12:21  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Add wireframe engine (partly to help debug label issues)

2007-04-02 07:27  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Label rendering engine added. Needs work. Possibly using an
	  overlay?

2007-04-02 07:01  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Forgotten File

2007-04-02 07:01  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Refactored AvogadroApp -> Application to maintain naming
	  scheme.

	  Added EngineListView to list the engines and allow them to be
	  enabled/disabled
	  accordingly. Engines now maintain their own PrimitiveQueue. This
	  will allow
	  us (in the future) to allow advanced users to add/remove
	  atoms/bond/residues
	  accordingly from an engine. (in the case that i only want a
	  certain atom or
	  set of atoms rendered.

2007-03-28 18:26  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Added open events for Mac (i.e., now can drag-and-drop files
	  from the Finder)

2007-03-28 15:50  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Add Mac OS X app bundle target

2007-03-28 15:50  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Scale icon to 256x256

2007-03-28 15:49  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Added Mac OS X resources directory

2007-03-28 15:48  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Make sure to install in "tools" subdirectory

2007-03-26 06:26  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Refactored SetVector3d and GetVector3d to setPos and pos after
	  discussing with
	  Benoit. We agreed that this sticks with our Avogadro API
	  convention.

2007-03-26 06:20  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Added some svn:ignore properties.

2007-03-26 06:08  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Deleted trash file.

2007-03-26 06:07  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Moved tools to libavogadro:
	  - Added ToolGroup which manages a group of tools.
	  - Moved avogadro "plugins" to "extensions". (removed tools)

2007-03-24 18:10  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : adapt to latest constness change in OpenBabel

2007-03-24 12:35  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : In Draw: standardize on passing GLWidget *widget to the various
	  methods,
	  from which both the molecule and the center can be retrieved.
	  Maybe evaluate
	  letting the Tool know which GLWidget it's operating in, gettable
	  with glwidget()?
	  That would spare much argument-passing.

	  Add API documentation and explanatory code comments to
	  unProject().

2007-03-24 12:00  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : In class Atom: Rename position() to GetVector3d() and
	  setPosition() to SetVector3d().
	  This underlines the fact that they're just wrappers for
	  GetVector() and SetVector() from OBAtom,
	  doing casts with Eigen::Vector3d.

	  Rewrite these functions to make sure they don't cause copies, and
	  inline them. Add documentation.
	  A "rationale for inlining" is provided in comment, to justify
	  that inlining isn't dangerous here.

2007-03-23 17:57  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Add contributed icon to about dialog

2007-03-23 17:56  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Add full third-row elements (e.g., sulfur, phosphorus...)

2007-03-23 17:54  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Switch GAMESS automoc -- don't know why, but this one actually
	  works.

2007-03-21 20:45  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Commiting cryo's patch for the navigate plugin. (ie. importing
	  navigation
	  functionality from Kalzium.

2007-03-21 10:04  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : add comments to the code of Camera::initializeViewPoint()

2007-03-21 09:38  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : Simplification and improvement of Camera::applyPerspective()
	  Now it should have reached it's "canonical" form.

2007-03-21 08:54  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : Document class Camera

2007-03-21 07:16  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : Rework Camera::applyPerspective().
	  That fixes the clipping bug for very small molecules.

2007-03-21 05:29  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Fixes linking error. Was not generating moc file because the
	  cpp file was
	  missing #include "gamessinputdialog.moc" at the bottom of the
	  file. This
	  caused by change to MOC generation to more KDE-like operation.

2007-03-20 22:35  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Added wheel function to plugins to allow handling of wheel
	  events on the GLWidget.

2007-03-19 18:30  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : Fix compilation (after removal of molgeominfo.*).

2007-03-19 17:00  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Removed the MolGeomInfo class. It's really not needed as all
	  this info can
	  happily exist in the Molecule class and techincally should. The
	  GLWidget makes
	  it's own copies of this info when it wants to by
	  GLWidget::updateGeometry(). I
	  believe this class was most likely introduced as a way to get the
	  info to the
	  Engines, but really they should know their parent.

2007-03-19 11:48  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : fix the auto-multiple-bonds-oritentation feature from kalzium
	  That is, now when you load a molecule the double bonds are
	  automatically
	  oriented to face the camera in the default viewpoint. So that
	  they don't
	  look like single bonds.

	  This implied API changes in engines: now render must be passed
	  the molGeomInfo structure,
	  as it needs to know the normal vector of the molecule's fitting
	  plane.

2007-03-19 11:22  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : adjust initial viewpoint on loaded molecule. remove unused
	  define.

2007-03-19 11:08  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : Fix bug where atoms created on an empty molecule were not
	  shown.
	  The problem was twofold:
	  -molGeomInfo wasn't getting updated
	  -with an empty molecule, applyPerspective set
	  nearPlane==farPlane, thus
	  nothing would be drawn until molGeomInfo would be updated.

2007-03-19 10:40  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : - much improved Draw::moveAtom: now moves the atom within the
	  iso-z-distance of
	  the molecule's center
	  - introduce MolGeomInfo class, stores the geometric info of a
	  molecule
	  - take geom info out of class Molecule
	  - remove Molecule's d-pointer (nothing left there)
	  - remove mutex stuff in Molecule
	  - add d->molGeomInfo member to GLWidget, MUST BE UPDATED BY HAND
	  - fix Atom::position() (interfacing coord vectors with Eigen)

2007-03-18 21:22  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : Unscrew the selectrotate tool, after migration to the Camera
	  class caused some damage.
	  Donald: I hope I reproduced the original behavior, if not, just
	  tell me.

2007-03-18 21:00  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : rename GL_SEL_BUF_SIZE : the GL_ prefix should be reserved to
	  the OpenGL API.
	  Move that define to top of file.

2007-03-18 18:17  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : this isn't fully finished but at least it compiles and runs.
	  I prefer to commit early to prevent a conflict.

	  - add new Camera class
	  - rework glwidget.* to use it, opengl cleanups, API changes
	  - fixes here and there

	  If you get crashes, please delete the old .so files and retry.

2007-03-16 10:10  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : use a mutex in the Molecule class to make sure that recomputing
	  geom info
	  blocks any operation that might access it concurrently.

2007-03-16 09:54  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : Make Primitive's d-pointer private
	  Move Molecule's data to a d-pointer
	  Cache the molecule geometric info. Still need to evaluate
	  potential
	  thread-safeness issues.

2007-03-16 07:38  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : remove unneeded variable numAtoms and remove "using namespace
	  OpenBabel"

2007-03-15 18:43  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Cleaning commented code.

2007-03-15 17:22  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Removed _vatom / _vbond from Molecule class (not needed) and
	  fixed up the
	  iterator stuff in primitives.cpp for Benoit. (specifically the
	  computGeometricInfo function).

2007-03-15 16:11  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Document Changes.
	  Merged in Benoit's changes.

2007-03-15 08:02  Carsten Niehaus <carsten.niehaus@gmail.com>

	* : This syncs Avo with KDE again. Beside some cosmetic sugar this
	  adds much
	  improved support for Windows (I think...). Anyway, we now have
	  for
	  example this line in the file:

	  [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\OpenBabel\ 2.0.2]

	  I think that we all agree that both Kalzium and Avo want to
	  depend on OB
	  2.1.0, right? The current beta still installs as 2.0.2 which
	  cannot be
	  the correct way to do, I think. Geoff told us yesterday that
	  branching
	  is about 2 weeks in the future, please lets increase that version
	  number
	  then so that those clashes can be fixed!

2007-03-15 07:59  Carsten Niehaus <carsten.niehaus@gmail.com>

	* : sync with KDE. FindEigen moved to kdelibs now! In the future
	  (from next monday on) it will only be in kdelibs, no longer in
	  kdeedu or koffice!

2007-03-14 12:02  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : Implement computation and storage of geometric information in
	  the Molecule class,
	  replacing the former approach consisting in changing molecule
	  coordinates.

2007-03-13 23:34  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Converted cmake files to use qt4_automoc format. More KDE like.

2007-03-13 21:57  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : about dialog compilation fixed. thanks carsten.

2007-03-12 13:48  Carsten Niehaus <carsten.niehaus@gmail.com>

	* : New about dialog. Here it works but I think the moc-thing is
	  wrong.
	  Could somebody with more moc-foo check this, please?

2007-03-12 07:51  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : Add Molecule::centerAndFitInXYPlane() method.
	  Just to demonstrate it, call it from GLWidget::setMolecule().
	  Some sparse cleanup in Cylinder and Sphere.

2007-03-09 18:46  Carsten Niehaus <carsten.niehaus@gmail.com>

	* : Make CMake 2.4.3 the minimumversion needed. KDE will move to
	  require 2.4.5 on March, 19th.

2007-03-09 11:14  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Release 0.0.3 updates. Fixed avogadro.nsi to include
	  ghemical.prm so that the optimization parameters are included in
	  the install. Booyah.

2007-03-09 09:52  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Misspelled USING_DYNAMIC_LIBS. What a mistake. Fixed the
	  CMakeLists.txt files.

2007-03-09 01:45  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Added USING_OBDLL and USING_DYNAMIC_LIBS to build defines.

2007-03-08 09:42  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Updated mainwindow.ui.

	  TODO: Refactor so that variables are named descriptionType
	  instead of typeDescription.

	  All mainwindow actions need to be renamed.

2007-03-08 09:00  Carsten Niehaus <carsten.niehaus@gmail.com>

	* : Remove a lot unused includes. Includes shouldn't be in
	  .h-files, use forward declaration here

2007-03-08 08:47  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Minor misspellings and added units to the recalculate hessian
	  spin box.

2007-03-08 08:34  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Done with ui and working.

2007-03-08 02:46  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Compiles. Some signals are not correctly connected. Will fix
	  later but wanted
	  to make the commit before carsten wakes back up.

2007-03-07 23:16  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Refactoring GamessInputBuilder -> GamessInputDialog.

	  More appropriately named.

2007-03-07 23:09  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : My version of the dialog. With tree and tabs etc etc. Widgets
	  named accordingly.

2007-03-07 23:08  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Needed Qt4OpenGL include so that GLuint named a type.

2007-03-07 23:07  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Updated include precedence. Should fix some compile errors.
	  Just so that when
	  you build you are getting the header files from your build
	  directory and not
	  the installed ones.

2007-03-07 13:10  Carsten Niehaus <carsten.niehaus@gmail.com>

	* : adding those strange string. No idea what they are for, though

2007-03-07 13:04  Carsten Niehaus <carsten.niehaus@gmail.com>

	* : * Bling, about 3000 lines diff. Oh my god :)

2007-03-07 12:31  Carsten Niehaus <carsten.niehaus@gmail.com>

	* : Muhu, a big step, another 500 lines of diff :-) I added default
	  values,
	  added some new widgets, improved layout...

2007-03-07 12:13  Carsten Niehaus <carsten.niehaus@gmail.com>

	* : One more tab done

2007-03-07 12:00  Carsten Niehaus <carsten.niehaus@gmail.com>

	* : 2 more tabs done

2007-03-07 11:34  Carsten Niehaus <carsten.niehaus@gmail.com>

	* : muha, integrating Donalds stuff, some this and that

2007-03-07 11:19  Carsten Niehaus <carsten.niehaus@gmail.com>

	* : Commit my patch: No inludes in the .h-file if possible

2007-03-07 11:18  Carsten Niehaus <carsten.niehaus@gmail.com>

	* : More close to the original

2007-03-07 10:57  Carsten Niehaus <carsten.niehaus@gmail.com>

	* : First version of the dialog, now in Designer

2007-03-07 10:54  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : don't include QGLWidget when not needed; documentation fixes

2007-03-07 10:51  Carsten Niehaus <carsten.niehaus@gmail.com>

	* : test commit (adding copyright-year)

2007-03-07 10:46  Benoit Jacob <jacob@math.jussieu.fr>

	* : Remove all mentions of the USE_DISPLAY_LISTS define, always use
	  display lists (instead of never)
	  for the sphere and cylinder.

	  This fixes an issue with the way avo reused the sphere/cylinder
	  code from Kalzium:
	  avo used a display list for the whole molecule, but not for the
	  spheres and cylinders,
	  which caused the geometric data and the opengl traffic of each
	  sphere/cylinder to be replicated into
	  the molecule display list. This caused the rendering to be
	  unnecessarily slow and memory-consuming.

2007-03-07 09:54  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Added GAMESS plugin install line.

2007-03-07 09:04  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Update for building 0.0.3alpha Win32 release.

2007-03-07 08:19  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : flattabwidget.cpp: return proper integer
	  CMakeLists.txt: remove garbage left over from initial testing of
	  gamess plugin.

2007-03-06 23:42  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : installer file changes

2007-03-06 19:17  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : GAMESS Input Deck Plugin Complete. Non-Modal Dialog.

2007-03-06 11:20  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Gamess Interface Updates. Still not incorporated into the
	  plugin. This will happen tomorrow.

2007-03-02 08:53  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : More changes to the GAMESS Input Deck Generator. Almost
	  finished. Need to add
	  some more specific information. At some point a lot of the
	  callbacks need to
	  be refactored to another class. For now they are alright. This is
	  very big
	  and complex. Not fun.

2007-03-02 01:28  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Working good so far. Not yet a plugin.

2007-03-01 05:56  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Backing up before deleteing a bunch of unnecisary functions.
	  Code taken from WxMacMolPlt GNU Licensed.

2007-02-26 07:24  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : More ugly. My Bad.

2007-02-26 07:15  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : cmake files needed updating for finding paths correctly.

2007-02-25 02:58  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Tim Vandermeersch's Patch for ghemical. Cleaned up mainwindow.h
	  so it'd compile.

2007-02-25 02:37  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Added new FlatTabWidget for Messages. Needs working on but will
	  be really sweet.

2007-02-24 04:50  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Messages are now printed to the messages window. It's very hard
	  to see but
	  it's at the bottom of the GL area. You can see a small dotten
	  line, which you
	  can drag up and see the messages. I'm working on a better
	  interface for this,
	  unfortanly it's not built into the default QT widgets. More to
	  come.

2007-02-22 22:47  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Some repeated code. Factored out into the newBond function.

2007-02-21 22:58  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Fix problem with zero'ed coordinates. Begin/EndModify strike
	  again!

2007-02-21 22:48  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Update build environment

2007-02-21 22:47  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Update to fix draw and hydrogen problems from Begin/EndModify
	  in OBMol.

2007-02-21 22:47  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Add support for Ghemical minimization using Open Babel
	  OBForceField

2007-02-19 01:59  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Fixed bug in glwidget.h with GLHit constructure being
	  ill-defined.
	  Updated cmake files to incorporated dependancy (multi-threaded
	  make now works).
	  Added plugin to Add/Removed Hydrogens. Having problems which i
	  believe are in OpenBabel.

2007-02-09 07:27  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : moved nsis file

2007-02-08 23:09  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Removed STL dependancy. (Should reduce windows QT dlls).

2007-02-08 03:17  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : corrected names.

2007-02-08 02:25  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : added mxvc2005 file.

2007-02-04 15:22  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Add bond order to draw tool.

2007-02-03 20:23  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : had extra include in there.

2007-02-03 18:49  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Updated WIN32 compiling parameters, added icons/avogadro.ico
	  and nsis installer file.

2007-02-03 01:33  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : more WIN32 changes. Added some GL defines that were missing.
	  added return value on GLHit = operator.

2007-02-03 00:58  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Updates for windows.

2007-02-03 00:36  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Missing files!!! arg... too many commits.

2007-02-03 00:36  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Added global header.

2007-02-03 00:34  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Cleaned up config.h

	  config.h should contain the install paths and version and package
	  name. Needs updating.

2007-02-03 00:32  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Rather than using an include file for WIN32 we should just
	  define it as a compile time definition.

2007-02-03 00:05  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Done with changes. Defines are properly setup.

2007-02-03 00:00  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : about to be renamed again.

2007-02-02 23:44  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Broken for two min.

2007-02-02 21:27  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : MoleculeTreeView no longer has ambiguous constructor.
	  Sphere no longer has ambiguous call to sqrt.

2007-02-02 21:25  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Added #include "config.h"

2007-02-02 21:16  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Update for WIN32 defines for compilation on windows. Exporting
	  of DLL classes.

2007-02-02 21:15  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Update properties to ignore temporary source files

2007-02-02 21:12  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Updated plugin paths: split by colon...

	  PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin (etc)

2007-01-28 23:14  Geoffrey Hutchison <geoff@geoffhutchison.net>

	* : Updated link commands to work on Mac OS X.

2007-01-27 01:01  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Molecules weren't disconnecting properly. The disconnect()
	  member function
	  disconnects "this" from other things, not other things from
	  'this'.

	  Also fixed compile issues from the last commit.

2007-01-26 21:21  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Updated changes from library.

2007-01-26 21:20  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Fixed plugin.h to compile.

2007-01-24 19:37  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Added plugin interface (incomplete).

	  Added tabs at bottom for messages and other information we wish
	  to have.

2007-01-24 07:06  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Moved combobox to avogadro app.

2007-01-24 07:01  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Modifications... will be moved.

2007-01-24 06:52  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Extra Line

2007-01-24 06:51  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Working CMakeLists

2007-01-24 02:59  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Rename

2007-01-24 02:59  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Using generated ui.

	  Added tool properties.

	  adding ElementComboBox

2007-01-23 19:49  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : NORMALIZE bonds instead of RESCALE_NORMAL

2007-01-23 18:39  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Updated FindEigen.cmake from pinotree.

2007-01-23 18:23  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Updated cmake files and added psuedo include dir.

2007-01-23 15:12  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Missing files!

2007-01-23 08:40  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : updated tooltip / text minor change.

2007-01-23 08:30  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Updated name() and description() to const functions.

	  Made it so that if a tool doesn't defined an Icon / Text /
	  Tooltip
	  it will be correctly populated using name() and description().

2007-01-23 08:00  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : ui_mainwindow.h defines Ui::MainWindow which is a private
	  member of
	  Avogadro::MainWindow. QTDesigner does a crappy job with naming
	  the layouts and
	  embedding widgets within widgets that don't need to be that way.
	  There is a
	  bit of renaming done so that we can use our FlowLayout (ripped
	  from the
	  tutorials).

	  Added icons to actions. Images are from CrystalClear collection.

	  Made libavogadro const-correct as well as implementing the
	  d-pointer technique
	  in glWidget and Primitives classes.

	  Figured out a memory leak in OpenBabel.

	  Updated the TreeView to match pointers rather than indexes. This
	  could become
	  a bottleneck if we have to delete a lot of primitives from a big
	  molecule.
	  We'll tackle that when we cross that bridge. Would give us
	  something like
	  O(n^2) when we should really have O(n). Although that could be
	  wrong i was
	  never good with big O.

	  Added resource files. Plugins now define an action which selects
	  them. They
	  can connect to the callback but it doesn't them little good. The
	  MainWindow
	  decides what tool gets called. This just gives the plugin the
	  ability to
	  define it's own tooltips / icon. tool.h defines a default action
	  but this
	  action doesn't get any information from the implemented plugin.

2007-01-22 07:54  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Added const correctness.

2007-01-07 21:56  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Draw tools done. Fixed some bugs.

2007-01-07 10:16  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Can now draw atoms into the model. No bonds yet but it also
	  updates the
	  treewidget through callbacks. However, primitiveAdded(Primitive
	  *) should
	  actually be admitted *after* the primitive has been added to the
	  model.
	  Otherwise we would need to overload everytime that the indexes
	  change.

	  Need to discuss further with Geoff and crew.

2007-01-07 02:42  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Cleanup. Old Project files we don't need.

2007-01-07 02:39  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Rather than using a view on top of a model i created a custom
	  view widget for
	  our Primitive::Molecule. I haven't updated all the signals but
	  this is now
	  what we will use. It looks better and is easier to manage. Plus I
	  got it
	  looking sweeet.

2007-01-06 19:51  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : New Molecule is Working... signal to GLWidget needs to be
	  updated.

2007-01-06 19:14  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Updated to use new Molecule which has QAbstractItemModel.

2007-01-06 19:13  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Cleanup!

2007-01-06 19:13  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Moved MoleculeModel *into* Molecule.

	  Thus, a Molecule acts as a QAbstractItemModel.

2007-01-06 18:33  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Moved ProjectModel to library.

2007-01-06 17:59  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Updated the primitives enum. Also reworked ProjectModel so that
	  it works
	  directly with the molecule. Should be moved to the library. The
	  view needs to
	  be updated so that it subgroups. This should not be part of the
	  model. (ie.
	  the model should not contain "dummy" nodes just so that we have
	  groupings of
	  Atoms, Bonds, Residues.). Avogadro::GLWidget needs to be updated
	  to use the
	  MoleculeModel instead of working on the Molecule itself.

2007-01-06 02:51  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Added Docks for Tools and for the Project Layout.

	  The project layout is model/view. ProjectModel, given a molecule,
	  sets up the
	  model for the molecular view. I'm not sure if this is the correct
	  place for
	  this. I believe it could go into the libavogadro. It's a tossup
	  because we
	  may want to have our Model be the basis for interaction with the
	  library but
	  the way the GL engine is setup, it takes primitives directly to
	  render them.
	  This isn't a problem as we can setup our primitives to act as
	  nodes of the
	  model. Will think about this more.

2007-01-06 00:21  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Adding project model.

2007-01-05 21:02  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Minor Changes

2007-01-05 20:48  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Draw tool now draws. Need to refine these tools. Also need
	  configuration
	  system implemented for the tools. TODO: create a Tool Properties
	  Dialog.

2007-01-05 09:24  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Added the drawing tool but it doesn't work. There is no code.
	  Had an issue
	  where the header files were included from the wrong location.
	  Should be easy
	  to implement the drawing tool in the next day. Also need to build
	  an extension
	  for other plugins (gamess / libghemical). Should be interesting
	  then.

2007-01-05 01:34  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Added tools/CMakeLists.txt

2007-01-04 22:09  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Should compile and run.

	  bsengine is Ball and Stick and currently works. Need to bring the
	  other stuff
	  up to date.

	  the select&rotate tool now works too. haven't finished cleaning
	  up the
	  functions and working on creating the drawing tool.

2007-01-04 16:17  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Should compile now. Must checkout the whole trunk to build the
	  cmake files.

2007-01-03 20:42  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Minor changes.. Still won't build.. Need to finish up the work
	  tonite.

2007-01-03 20:37  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Leftover file. This commit doesn't build. No time to fix til
	  later tonite.

2007-01-03 20:36  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Added cmake/modules for CMAKE building.

2007-01-03 19:49  Donald Ephraim Curtis <dcurtis3@sourceforge.net>

	* : Moving things around. Conforming to a more KDE-like layout in
	  SVN. I'm going nuts. SOrry
