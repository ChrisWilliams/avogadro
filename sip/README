SIP python bindings:

to compile:

In order for the sip bindings to work, I had to export Painter and PainterDevice 
(class A_EXPORT Painter...). If these classes are not exported, you can't define
all pure virtual functions in engines and the generated cpp files don't compile...


$ python configure.py
$ make
$ sudo make install

example script: 

$ python test.py
